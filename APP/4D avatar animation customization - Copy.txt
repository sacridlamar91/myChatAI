#Here are a few additional recommendations for the pet customization feature:

    Use a library like PyOpenGL or Pyglet to create the 4D animated version of the pet and allow the user to manipulate it in real-time.

    Offer a wide range of customization options, such as different hairstyles, outfits, and accessories for the pet to wear.

    Allow the user to save multiple versions of their pet and switch between them using a drop-down menu or button.

    Implement a feature that allows users to leave likes on other users' pets and display the total number of likes on the pet customization page.

    Consider adding a feature that allows users to share their customized pets on social media or with their friends through a unique URL.

    Consider adding a feature that allows users to earn rewards or in-app currency for customizing their pets, which they can then use to unlock new customization options.

    Add a feature that allows users to name their pets and display the name on the pet customization page.

    Add a feature that allows users to select a background for their pet to be displayed in, such as a park, beach, or cityscape.
