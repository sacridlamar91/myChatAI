To anyone reading this while listening to this music, I know what you feel, you’re probably even crying right now, but whatever can happen to you is nothing compared to what you have accomplished and who you are. You are an amazing person and never let anyone make you feel otherwise. You might be having a bad time, but behind walls is always happiness. Have a great day/week/month/year and remember that nothing is worth loosing your life. ??

Reading these comments, as a young teen, has made me realize that I make myself feel more worthless than I actually am. Reading these comments has made me tear up with both sadness and realization. The music aided in the tears, but everyone has reasons for listening to this. Just know this, whoever is taking their time to read this comment, that you are loved. You may never hear the words, but your parents love you; your grandparents love you; your siblings love you; your family loves you; your pets love you; your friends love you; those you hold dear to your soul, they love you. Never forget that.

PS: I just wanna say, I keep my emotions bottle up, yet give others advice on how to live, or why they should. I hate seeing others deal with what I go through, and yet, I never listen to my own words or advice. I stay stubborn; I never seek help; I never cry unless I get extremely hurt; I never say "I love you" even if I do. I struggle with being hard on myself and bottled up emotions from my years of school, and will continue doing it. Even if everyone in my life was to say "Hey, it's ok, just tell me what's wrong" I won't open up, I'll keep my emotions to myself. Even if everyone comments that they're here for me, I won't open up. It's my decision, it's not the best, but it works for me. I hope you guys take my words, and do the opposite of my terrible decision. Use advice others give you, they don't want you to end up like them. Those who give you advice truly love you, and want to see you rise above others, they want you to grow high above the clouds, they want to see you sucessful, they want to know you did things that they themself couldn't achieve, just to be proud of someone. Have a good rest of 2022 and may 2023 hold better days <3

Dear person whoever reads this, 

Hey, you, yes, I am talking right to you. I hope you will see yourself with the eyes I see you one day, because I can tell you have some awesome music taste :) You’re such a beautiful human being and worth and enough. I hope you know that you do only need yourself to be happy, I know society build up the standard that whenever you’re alone you’re not living a happy live. But in fact that is not true, if you start to realize that you actually deserve all the good things happening to you, you will treat yourself a lot  nicer. I hope you let yourself rest, don’t beat yourself up over past mistakes, over regret, and over everything your mind wants to destroy you. I wish I could remove all those demons inside of your head because you deserve to feel happy. If you ever feel lonely then watch the sky, because you know, someone, at the same time is watching the sky too, maybe feeling the same way..I am glad you exist and I hope you won’t ever remove your own spot in this world, maybe you don’t feel like you belong here but, Angel, then build your home here. I don’t want you to leave this world unhappy. I want you to live every little second, I want you to feel alive, I don’t want you to see yourself just existing. You deserve it. Whatever happened, it’s not your fault, the demons in your head recognize that you have a beautiful heart, they want to take it because they have never seen such beautiful heart as yours, so why let them win over you? . You’re not selfish for isolating yourself, but you deserve to talk to someone. If you’re reading this than please never forget to breath and smile. 



Don’t live up to other standards! It’s your story and not theirs. 





Life for those who couldn’t, smile for those who forgot what a genuine smile is, love like there’s no other, hug like its your last one. 



I love you and send you hugs.

You’re so strong, you’re still here, and I am proud of you. 





YOU ARE NOT USELESS. READ THAT AGAIN. 

YOU ARE WORTH IT. READ THAT AGAIN.

YOU ARE LOVED. READ THAT AGAIN.

I AM GLAD YOU EXIST. READ THAT AGAIN.

YOU ARE NOT A PROBLEM. YOU ARE HUMAN AND YOUR FEELINGS ARE VALID. READ THAT AGAIN.

YOU ARE NOT BEING DRAMATIC. 



You’re not a burden to anyone, don’t be afraid to talk, to use your voice. 



You’re beautiful inside out. Your body is beautiful the way it is. 



Please don’t starve yourself. Please eat, I know it’s hard but you deserve food. You deserve to eat and drink. 



I LOVE YOU SO MUCH. READ THAT AGAIN.



I WISH I COULD HUGH YOU RIGHT NOW, SO A VIRTUAL HUG WILL DO. 





It hurts me to see you’re in pain :( you deserve so much man, don’t let your emotions control you. Don’t let them get the best of you. 



I love u I love u I love u I love u I love u please don’t go.





I am sorry that no one is hearing you, I am sorry no one is noticing that you have lost yourself. I wish I could take your pain away, it hurts me to see the pain in your eyes.  I love you trough my words and I mean it. I just want you to stay, hold on a little longer okay? Please? For me.??



I hope you have an awesome day/ morning/ evening/ night. 



If it’s night for you, go to sleep, I know it’s hard to fall asleep right now but you deserve a good sleep. If you have nightmares, please, don’t let them fight you. 



If it’s day for you, don’t start it by such sad music, I know it’s impossible to have a good day with such mindset but take baby steps, start by drinking two cups of water in the morning and so on.. You will start building little healthy habits. 



If it’s evening for you, you’re probably overwhelmed and stressed, I want you to know it’s okay to feel the way you feel. You don’t need to be scared, of course you’re overwhelmed or stressed, I mean who wouldn’t? But it’s important to know that when you feel that way you should do a little self care, such as taking a bath for example? You deserve to feel at ease and relaxed.





And if you are somewhere in between I hope you know that you’re stronger than you think, I know you will make it :) 



All I want for you is to stay and feel alive. 



Now wipe those tears away and smile for me, you really don’t know much a smile can brighten someone’s day, do you? I hope one day yours will become a genuine one where you don’t need to fake it anymore, because I can’t say this enough, you deserve a good smile and to feel alive. You’re worth more than every fucking cent in this world.



I need you here with me :). 



Remember crying is not weakness, let it out as much as you can but don’t let the emotion control you by giving up. It’s okay, you’re here, you’re safe, you can let it out.



Did anyone asked you, how you are feeling today? If not, how are you really? I don’t think you’re doing good, but you will feel good at one point. Don’t give yourself up. 



I am sorry you feel misunderstood.



But anyone who gets to be with you, doesn’t know how fucking lucky he/ she/ they is :).



Enough with beating up yourself for today, okay?!



- The stranger that cares about you more than anything.



I hope this is enough for you to stay today, tomorrow will be a new day, a new start, let go now. I hope you can stay.



This is your sign to stay and treat yourself with love, you deserve it.



And in case no one told you today, again, I am so proud of you. 





I hope you will remember my words.



Until tomorrow, my friend ??<3  !!
-Me??

They didnt notice you were crying
They did notice you were sad
They didn’t notice you were tired
They didn’t notice you were alone
They didn’t notice how attentive you were
They didn’t notice how sweet you actually are...
They didn’t notice how you actually try to make others smile



They did notice you failing grades
They did notice your unattractive 
They did notice the mean side of you
They did notice all your mistakes 
They did notice all you flaws
They did notice that you weren’t good enough for them.



But you stayed strong
You kept going on
You never gave up on hope
You never let then take you down
And you know they wasn’t good enough for you
And that’s what make you stronger 

Stay safe everyone ?(crd first writer)

"One day after my suicide"?



The day after my suicide, I loved my mother even more, when I saw her crying on the floor of my room, hugging my clothes with my photos scattered around her, I saw so much love post the tears in her eyes.



The day after my suicide, I felt how much my father loved me, no matter how hard it was, In the midst of so much sadness, he spoke to me with tears in his eyes about how proud he was of me and how much he loved me.



The day after my suicide, I saw my furry best friend was more incredible than I could imagine. Everytime someone came home, he would run to the door exited to see me and seeing that it was not me, would lay down in front of the door and continue waiting for me.



The day after my suicide, I felt the love of my sister when I saw her sitting in her room with eyes full of tears. She remembered the times we played, talked and argued together in our beautiful childhood. Treasured moments.



The day after my suicide I felt how important I was to my friends. They were looking at all our pictures together..... remembering the laughs we shared.



The day after my suicide, I felt the sorrow in my teachers. They blamed themselves for not noticing.



At night I went to the morgue to look for myself and said "so many dreams we had" "So many loved ones" "so many people to meet" "you had so many people that loved you, yet you threw it all away ?" "You have to have a lot of courage to take your life why didn't you use that courage to win!"



Thank goodness that was just a vision.



Remember :

You are still here and can change your life forever. You are better than you think you are prettier smarter and stronger.



Disclaimer :

This is not my story. I just wanted to spread it because may be it helps some people. 



Thank you ????????

Hello everyone, I am well aware that many of you that have decided to listen to this video may be going through a very  challenging time in your life. My words may or may not affect you, but I feel the need to let you know them anyway. You are not alone in this world, although we may have never meet before, I understand your pain more than you may know. Understand others may understand and feel similar pain  too. Whatever you make be going through do not sit back and kill your soul in the darkness. You will get through whatever you are facing. You have to believe in yourself even if no one else does. Trust me it will be beyond hard, but fight for the peace and happiness you deserve. You must stay strong and never give up on what you would like for yourself in the future. You are enough no matter who you are or what you have done. Do not let the pain defeat you, instead let it make you stronger and learn from all the pain. It will be very tough, but believe in yourself for I believe in you! Don't give up or in, NO MATTER WHAT!

I have lived forty five years.  A short childhood with some bitter happiness.  I was forced to grow up quickly by circumstances beyond anyone’s control.   
I learned to please only those who raised me.  I grew up swearing I will not repeat the first twenty years of my life.  I found life’s company, treated them with all the love I could give. I was betrayed. I forgave. Ten years later I still do not feel appreciated. Life is fair. Some are just more fair than others. We make our choices and have to live with the consequences of our decisions.  Today I realized something new. I have always lived in fear. Fear of unhappiness and fear of losing my happiness. I will not  live in fear again as I have nothing else to lose to fear.

Tonight I finally broke down after 5 months of being separated from my wife who I’m still in love with. I found out there was another person she fell for while we were together. I’ve been ignoring my feelings about that all day, but when I tried to sleep my mind started racing and finally I broke down and it’s all hitting me so hard tonight. God please help take this pain alway, I just want my heart to catch up to my head. 
For me there's nothing more painful than when your girlfriend tells you you're perfect for her, only for her to then leave you four days later. Feels impossible to get over her, especially since I still love her.

Anybody else feel like whatever reason you're sad about is nothing compared to other people's problems? That it's too trivial and you feel guilty that you're "just crying about it and not doing anything" or "making a fuss about it"?
Don't ever compare yourself to others. Everyone's reason for depression or just feeling down is just as valid as someone else's. We all experience sadness, guilt, shame, heartbreak, grief in different ways.

I came here to cry, because I am struggling with school and I always disappoint my parents. They think I am a failure. I get bullied at school, and the only thing that hears me out is the pillow when I cry on it. So, here is a message for you guys. Never give up on your dreams, and don't care what others think about you. You will succeed no matter what. Wish I could achieve this power.
Edit: Thank you all for the comments left, it's been a month, but I am cured now. I had to do therapy and things, but now I am better. And I know you guys can do the same and heal your hearts. Hope you are well and better. Peace!

Each time I was in depression, I think that no-one can understand me, and probably it is. No-one... But, when I read all this comments, I become more happier, because there are so many people who express their emotions same as my. Well, thanks to all of you for this really good comments, I hope there was someone who understands me. All in all, I believe that all of you find your happiness in your own life's, and you forgot about that word and that feeling, depression. Hope you OK now. Thanks)

To everyone suffering out there, to everyone out there who feels lost, hurt, broken, defeated, lost a loved one, recently went through a break up, feel like giving up, anyone who is going through your own battles, keep fighting, it's hard to deal with your own problems and stand to fight them, but I promise you that you are not alone. Keep your chin up, brighter days will be ahead. Everything will be alright, you will find what you seek, you will find the right one for you, you will find others who genuinely care for you. I believe in you, whoever reads this, keep fighting your battles with determination and a strong heart and mind. I'm rooting for you all. Thank you for hearing me till the end.

I am sorry to anyone going through a tough time I wish I could take away your pain, For those going through depression what works for me is taking one day at a time and finding that small thing that makes you smile or happy on that day. Being thankful that today something made you happy is the start of having a reason to go on.

I'm really glad people make videos like this. It makes me feel better and makes me realize that I'm not the only one who is going through a hard time. I feel like so many people have depression and are losing happy thoughts that normally come to mind. Though I also feel like it helps me realize who actually makes me happy and who I hate/dislike. It opens up a whole new world of dark thoughts but helps people at the same time.

I'm only 11 but I think moving houses and schools really hit me hard. I lost my grandma when I was 4 and that also hurts and so many more things come and kill me. Ik people tease each other but I feel like some people say things that are true but they don't know are true.

Just something for people to keep in mind: Don't be mean to others because you don't know what they might be going through when you're not around. Instead, be kind and comfort them and you might figure out what they're going through or if nothing has happened to them yet. But even if nothing has happened, you must still be kind because anything can happen at any time and you might not know it.

I've been hating myself lately. Back in high school I had a situation where i didn't react. A girl who I've seen in my old school but never met personally was staring at me while sitting down in front of a classroom. I thought she was there just waiting for a friend and was tired and resting her eyes since she had her legs towards her belly and her arms closed like if she was sleeping. Suddenly I walked past her for a second time with my best friend and she stared at me again for the second time and i did as well but i didn't think much of it. Classes were over and i was told by a classmate that she tried to take her own life inside the school by overdose and i got devastated. I could feel something was wrong with her but i didn't do anything. I got home and blamed myself for not helping her by asking if she was okay and even becoming a friend of her so she could forget about anything she had on her mind. I decided to stop being a bitch and sent her a message on her Instagram, she never saw it until a month after which was when she came back to school. She never talked to me personally but she texted in my Instagram being grateful for the message I've sent, how i was one of the people that made her grateful for her life and continuing on in this world even after all the bad things that has happened. Even after she said that to me i still hated myself. She was stalking me for a total of 2 months before this occurrence and i noticed her but was too shy to approach her, until this day i never knew if she had a crush on me or just stared at me for no reason. 

Today I'm in college it has been 4 years since that event and i still feel like i didn't do enough. Currently I've had a girl that have been glancing at me in class for over 2 months too but I'm still too shy to even say a word. I'm an introvert that struggles to talk to strangers to make friends, i always make friends bc people approach me. I am mad that i haven't said anything, i only have one month left until college is over and ill probably never see her again in the same class. I am still in doubt if she's glancing at me because she likes me or just a normal glance. I see a guy that seats behind her and seems very close with her like a close friend / best friend but i don't make a move because I'll feel bad if the guy likes her and i do something, i mean he came before me right? i wouldn't like to take his spot. 

I always overreact about things and this is one of the two occurrences i may overreact but i had to vent out here because the internet is the best place to do so. I am sorry you had to read this far, you might think I'm a stupid, overreacting bitch but that seems fair i guess. I just hope you never make the same mistake as i did and if you notice someone in help or looks like they need help approach them before its too late, you might be the person that they'll be grateful to have in life, never overreact and take action before its too late or you might regret it in the long term...

Life thought a good lesson 
Cry when you feel out 
Listen to music 
But don't trust anyone 
Talk with your parents 
Cause no one can love us more than our parents 
Talk with siblings if u have 
Tell your feelings on recorder ,record it
Help poor people 
Don't use phone for some days 
Sleep ?? 
Crying is not a weakness it is a let out u will feel better and really better
Involved in some other activities might help ??

Keep being happy don't be sad, keep the happy feeling don't keep the sad feeling just think about the happy past, why we were made is because we could be here for each other we will help each other even comfort each other, I once experience lost of best friend and it would hurt so much that I will cry out loud at night but that time I saw the happiness in my past and got happy and if you are feeling sad then let me tell you, you're beautiful if you're ugly no way you are not ugly you are perfect, God will help us in ways that is maybe bad but he help us on how he can be grateful you all are handsome and pretty if someone bullies you tell them this: "Have you ever been bullied? Why are you bullying? Are you gonna bully for the rest of your life? If your in trouble you will need the one you hate the most."

And just like that.. another year goes by... leaving us thinking: "What have I've done with my time..." realizing that you've done nothing and everyone else is brighter than you.. making you feel pointless... not worthy.. rejected, you know it and you keep telling yourself that tomorrow will be better but that tomorrow has still to show up. Leaving with your thoughts, alone, hoping that one day you could at least shine a little.... even for a bit. It's okay to feel that way, just hang tight and breathe.

to the person reading this,



It’s been hard for you, I know, and it makes me sad that you don’t see yourself in the way I see you. Sometimes they are things in life that cause us to lose ourselves, and the way you have is so unimaginable painful. I miss your smile, the way your eyes light up the whole room just by the sound of your laughter. I miss the way you accepted the way you look in the mirror without cursing yourself out about how ugly you look. I miss the way you didn’t think of yourself as a failure because everyone makes mistakes, we all have flaws and we all aren’t perfect. It’s painful to see that no one around you seems to see the pain through your eyes, but, stranger, I do, I see how heavy your heart is and how comforting the sadness for you might be, how afraid your heart is of happiness because it disappears in the end, right? You don’t know how much impact you have in this world and it’s sad to see that your demons fight against you and want to take over you. Because you do make a change, it’s something so simple and little that brightens up someone’s whole world, it can be a small smile from your lips, the way you look at things you’re passionate about, the way you make yourself eat even though it’s been hard for you lately, the way you zoom out and go in your own world, you brighten up my world by reading this, it means a lot to me that you’re here, existing, but I don’t want you to just exist, you deserve to feel alive. You deserve to get up in the morning and feel good about yourself. You deserve to feel something- to feel every damn second alive in this lifetime. It’s heartbreaking that you think you’re not capable of being loved because you are, I love you through all my words and I hope you let it happen in your heart. Love is scary, I know, maybe your heart had been broken once and since then you wanted to be rather numb than feel ever again, it hurts me how you punish yourself, does it not deserve love? Because YOU DO deserve love, please forgive yourself, it’s not your fault that the demons want to take over your beautiful heart. You’re not a bad person for distancing yourself from others, but you deserve someone to talk to, you deserve someone to listen. I am listening, you can tell me what’s wrong. It’s everything, isn’t it? There’s something pulling your heartstrings on the ground and no one seems to understand how misunderstood you feel, it’s heartbreaking to know that I am behind the screen and can’t give you a hug, that’s why I will give you a big warm virtual hug and send you lots of love :). You matter. You are worthy. You are loved. You deserve good things. You deserve someone to listen. You deserve to eat and drink. You deserve to feel good and alive. You deserve to smile. You deserve a hug. You deserve to be all the things you want to be because you deserve to have and feel good things happening to you and have a fulfilled life. I know I might not know you personally but I care about you so much, I write this because I want you to stay here with me, I want you to hold on a little longer because you matter so much to me, because I will not let you give up on yourself. I want you to see that you should not give up on yourself because you DESERVE GOOD THINGS. I want you to look back on the time when you were a kid, you didn’t give up when you tried to swim for the first time, you didn’t give up when you tried to walk for the first time and fell, you never gave up on yourself, you always kept on pushing forwards, so why can’t you now? I know it’s tiring, your mentally tired, but don't your younger self deserve good things? look back at your eyes that used to be full of hope, look back on those dreams. Don’t let yourself fall, you deserve better. We will both fight, I will fight for you. I won’t let those demons get to you. You can hold on to me, I won’t let you down :). Whenever you feel lonely, then look at the sky, I always look at it and think about you. Yes, you, because it makes me happy that there’s someone looking right back, maybe we can’t see each other but I can feel your presence here with me and that’s enough for me because I am glad your heart is beating and you’re still fighting. You’re so much stronger thank you think, you didn’t leave your spot on this earth even if you wanted to, you belong here, even though it doesn’t feel like it when you don’t feel like belonging then build your own home here, put all your love in it and dreams. Think of you as a star when you feel alone, you shine because your heart is good, no matter what mistake you made, no matter about the past you had, you’re one of the stars that shine bright in the universe because you’re heart is beautiful, that’s why the demons in your mind want to have it. As one of the stars you see other stars, maybe they have felt the same way as you do at some point in their life, but they lighten up the universe with each other’s presence. You’re a star for me, maybe you don’t see it yourself but I can see it, you’re beautiful from inside and out, your body is beautiful the way it is. You make me happy by reading this, you make me feel something by your presence, and when you can make me feel that way then you also make other people feel that way about you too. I hope you stay for yourself and don’t let your story get written by others but by yourself, it’s your story, not theirs. As you can see, I say a lot of “I hope” because I have hope for you even if you don’t have it for yourself, I see hope in you even though you might want to give up. That’s why I hope you won’t see the world in darkness and will see it colorful again, I hope I will give you a glimpse of hope and make the world you see a bit colorful for today. My favorite color is yellow, and I hope the next time you see the color yellow you will think about my words. If someone left you then don’t blame yourself, don’t think you weren’t enough, don’t lower yourself for someone who couldn’t see the awesomeness in you. If you lost someone I am so sorry for your loss, they want you happy, I hope you don’t feel guilty or regret because you were there, you spend enough time with them, they want you to be happy. They are in a good and safe place now. If someone broke your heart then I am so sorry that they couldn’t see the way you look so beautiful because of the heart you have. Anyone who gets to be with you doesn’t know how fucking lucky he/ she/ they are :). If you aren’t accepted at home or in general then I am so sorry that you have to deal with someone/ something you shouldn’t be ashamed of, I accept you and support you, I accept you as a human being no matter what race, religion, nationality, skin color, or sexuality you have. You’re safe here with me :). You’re not useless, you’re not a burden to anyone. You’re not a problem, you’re human and your feelings are valid. You’re not being dramatic. Please don’t starve yourself, you deserve food and to drink, I know it’s hard. It hurts to see that you’re in so much pain :( you deserve so much man, don’t let your emotions control you. Don’t let them get the best of you.  I am sorry no one is noticing, I wish /hope I could take your pain away for today or even for a moment while you’re reading this. If no one told you, I am so proud of you, you’re reading this and it’s enough for me to be proud of you because you’re here and that’s all that matters to me. If it’s the night for you, go to sleep, I know it’s hard to fall asleep right now but you deserve a good sleep. If you have nightmares, please, don’t let them fight you. If it’s the day for you, don’t start it with such sad music, I know it’s impossible to have a good day with such a mindset but take baby steps, start by drinking two cups of water every day in the morning, and so on. You will start building little healthy habits. If it’s the evening for you, you’re probably overwhelmed and stressed, I want you to know it’s okay to feel the way you feel. You don’t need to be scared, of course, you’re overwhelmed or stressed, I mean who wouldn’t? But it’s important to know that when you feel that way you should do a little self-care, such as taking a bath for example? You deserve to feel at ease and relaxed. 

And if you are somewhere in between I hope you know that you’re so strong for breathing despite the pain, I know you will make it :) I believe in you. All I want for you is to stay here, I really mean all my words, even if there is a lot of unsaid things I want to tell u and my text is getting longer and longer, I want you here. 



I hope one day your smile will become a genuine one where you don’t need to fake it anymore because I can’t say this enough, you deserve a good smile and to feel alive. You’re worth more than every fucking cent in this world.



You can let go for today, I got you, you can cry your heart out as much as you want, but don’t let it tear you down and let your emotions control you by giving up. Crying is not a weakness. If you still feel alone I dedicate you to a song as your friend.

“Dusk till Dawn- Zayn feat. Sia (I prefer the slow version)” I hope you can think of me and will remind yourself of my words, I will for sure think of you. 



In case no one told you and you’re unsure yourself, you’re a good person and I am so happy you’re here. 



I hope this is enough to stay today, tomorrow will be a new day, a new start, let go now. Enough with beating yourself up for today, okay? 



Life for those who couldn’t smile for those who forgot what a genuine smile is, love like there’s no other, hug-like it's your last one. 



If you read all of it, until tomorrow my friend :) 

have a good day and a great year.

Hey. I know the pain that is tearing you apart. Learn to forgive yourself for all the mistakes that you’ve made and/or learn to let go. Remember nothing is worth loosing your life over.  You are a precious star in this world, a beautiful light that shines like no other. Please don’t put it out. Remember there are more beautiful things in this world, try to focus on those. (Laughing so hard your stomach hurts) Stay safe out there and take care of yourself! ?

Reading these comments give me love and what you should feel too. Your mind always holds a bottle of ONE emotion. That emotion is made up of all emotions and can only stay hold if you trust your own gut & soul. As I am typing this I cam crying and to whoever is readying this, God Bless You I wish you have the best life and I love your confidence :). Don’t be scared. Stay right here with us all. The World will be happy nice and for all. I personally give you my love and you need a better day. Believe me when I say I love you :).

On the other side lighter or darker there is always love with you and around you. If you ever feel alone go to this comment and read this again. I read this myself and I cried my eyes out. NEVER feel alone even if your family died. There is always a solution and never ever a reason for death. Stay with us all as the world gets happier, and God brightens up for more people. Stop worrying and take atleast 10 minutes and feel like your are loved as you are. Always, and I’m saying that beacuse it’s true, always remember, You?? Black or white, dead or alive, anything, you are loved. By who? Grandparents, Parents, Siblings, Friends, Haters, God and many more. NEVER FORGET THAT. 

I need you stay with us at all costs, never think about doing naughty things and always stay loved. If you are a kid, a teenager, an adult or even and elderly person (no offence) you are loved. I hope your crying in a happy way and I’m spending my life typing this so the world can feel safe, I know not alot of people are gnna see this…. But I love you all And no one’s gonna Nan change that if I’m dead or alive.

Goodbye now… I wish you happy life… 
Love from God’s Trust.

If you feel not loved there's one thing that loves you and that's you! your faith is so strong that when people don't love you you'll hang in just like everyone tries you know not everyone succeeds to love there self its a real challenge it take yrs to know that how you live is so grateful think about those other people having to get walk hours just to drink dirty water You have a think of how lucky you are one you visit a country like that you'll love yourself so much that you have a wealthy life stay kind??

I was in love with this boy, and would not stop thinking "I'm gonna miss him too much.." I could not stop crying I hated it, and Still do To be honest And the worst part was I think he liked me I gave him a ring and he wore it the next day...

I just recently ended things permanently with my best friend because of something I did. I'm going through a lot actually. I have really bad anxiety and my parents don't trust me. Moved to a new school. People I thought were my friends turned out not to be. They all started ignoring me. I asked someone who said they liked me but they actually didn't. That one hurt. I fell in love with them but they didn't fall in love with me. Makes sense. I have hated myself everyday since and this playlist helped me. Sometimes all you need, is a good cry.

The reason I’m here is beacause I’m stupid. I thought about me instead of others. And that was the end of it. I thought we would at least make it through high school. I had two more years. We had talked about our future, like we had clue, I never thought I’d be losing her. I had loved her sense I was 12. I’m 16 now. Anyways, anyone here who has just gone through a break up. Don’t worry about it, there is so many other people that you can choose from. Try and get over it by listening to music like all of you are doing reading this, or talk to your friends, I know it might seem weird but just let your feelings poor out. Don’t try dating until you feel better. Don’t hurt yourself in anyway you will find another perso I promise.

Honestly, my daily basis is searching up. "Sad songs." But today I really needed it. My boyfriend of 7 months may not be able to talk to me again for 1 month max. But now proximately 4 and a half days and he will be crying to one of our other friends saying. "I'm so worried about V." This is the one type of playlist where I can make some common since and not worry about anything. Sit around and do nothing but think to myself, "what am I doing wrong?" Thank you for making these things. -Not a legend girl. ?????

To anyone reading this while listening to this music, I know what you feel, you’re probably even crying right now, but whatever can happen to you is nothing compared to what you have accomplished and who you are. You are an amazing person and never let anyone make you feel otherwise. You might be having a bad time, but behind walls is always happiness. Have a great day/week/month/year and remember that nothing is worth loosing your life. ??

to the person reading this,



It’s been hard for you, I know, and it makes me sad that you don’t see yourself in the way I see you. Sometimes they are things in life that cause us to lose ourselves, and the way you have is so unimaginable painful. I miss your smile, the way your eyes light up the whole room just by the sound of your laughter. I miss the way you accepted the way you look in the mirror without cursing yourself out about how ugly you look. I miss the way you didn’t think of yourself as a failure because everyone makes mistakes, we all have flaws and we all aren’t perfect. It’s painful to see that no one around you seems to see the pain through your eyes, but, stranger, I do, I see how heavy your heart is and how comforting the sadness for you might be, how afraid your heart is of happiness because it disappears in the end, right? You don’t know how much impact you have in this world and it’s sad to see that your demons fight against you and want to take over you. Because you do make a change, it’s something so simple and little that brightens up someone’s whole world, it can be a small smile from your lips, the way you look at things you’re passionate about, the way you make yourself eat even though it’s been hard for you lately, the way you zoom out and go in your own world, you brighten up my world by reading this, it means a lot to me that you’re here, existing, but I don’t want you to just exist, you deserve to feel alive. You deserve to get up in the morning and feel good about yourself. You deserve to feel something- to feel every damn second alive in this lifetime. It’s heartbreaking that you think you’re not capable of being loved because you are, I love you through all my words and I hope you let it happen in your heart. Love is scary, I know, maybe your heart had been broken once and since then you wanted to be rather numb than feel ever again, it hurts me how you punish yourself, does it not deserve love? Because YOU DO deserve love, please forgive yourself, it’s not your fault that the demons want to take over your beautiful heart. You’re not a bad person for distancing yourself from others, but you deserve someone to talk to, you deserve someone to listen. I am listening, you can tell me what’s wrong. It’s everything, isn’t it? There’s something pulling your heartstrings on the ground and no one seems to understand how misunderstood you feel, it’s heartbreaking to know that I am behind the screen and can’t give you a hug, that’s why I will give you a big warm virtual hug and send you lots of love :). You matter. You are worthy. You are loved. You deserve good things. You deserve someone to listen. You deserve to eat and drink. You deserve to feel good and alive. You deserve to smile. You deserve a hug. You deserve to be all the things you want to be because you deserve to have and feel good things happening to you and have a fulfilled life. I know I might not know you personally but I care about you so much, I write this because I want you to stay here with me, I want you to hold on a little longer because you matter so much to me, because I will not let you give up on yourself. I want you to see that you should not give up on yourself because you DESERVE GOOD THINGS. I want you to look back on the time when you were a kid, you didn’t give up when you tried to swim for the first time, you didn’t give up when you tried to walk for the first time and fell, you never gave up on yourself, you always kept on pushing forwards, so why can’t you now? I know it’s tiring, your mentally tired, but don't your younger self deserve good things? look back at your eyes that used to be full of hope, look back on those dreams. Don’t let yourself fall, you deserve better. We will both fight, I will fight for you. I won’t let those demons get to you. You can hold on to me, I won’t let you down :). Whenever you feel lonely, then look at the sky, I always look at it and think about you. Yes, you, because it makes me happy that there’s someone looking right back, maybe we can’t see each other but I can feel your presence here with me and that’s enough for me because I am glad your heart is beating and you’re still fighting. You’re so much stronger thank you think, you didn’t leave your spot on this earth even if you wanted to, you belong here, even though it doesn’t feel like it when you don’t feel like belonging then build your own home here, put all your love in it and dreams.

If you lost someone I am so sorry for your loss, they want you happy, I hope you don’t feel guilty or regret because you were there, you spend enough time with them, they want you to be happy. They are in a good and safe place now. If someone broke your heart then I am so sorry that they couldn’t see the way you look so beautiful because of the heart you have. Anyone who gets to be with you doesn’t know how fucking lucky he/ she/ they are :). If you aren’t accepted at home or in general then I am so sorry that you have to deal with someone/ something you shouldn’t be ashamed of, I accept you and support you, I accept you as a human being no matter what race, religion, nationality, skin color, or sexuality you have. You’re safe here with me :). You’re not useless, you’re not a burden to anyone. You’re not a problem, you’re human and your feelings are valid. You’re not being dramatic. Please don’t starve yourself, you deserve food and to drink, I know it’s hard. It hurts to see that you’re in so much pain :( you deserve so much man, don’t let your emotions control you. Don’t let them get the best of you.  I am sorry no one is noticing, I wish /hope I could take your pain away for today or even for a moment while you’re reading this. If no one told you, I am so proud of you, you’re reading this and it’s enough for me to be proud of you because you’re here and that’s all that matters to me. If it’s the night for you, go to sleep, I know it’s hard to fall asleep right now but you deserve a good sleep. If you have nightmares, please, don’t let them fight you. If it’s the day for you, don’t start it with such sad music, I know it’s impossible to have a good day with such a mindset but take baby steps, start by drinking two cups of water every day in the morning, and so on. You will start building little healthy habits. If it’s the evening for you, you’re probably overwhelmed and stressed, I want you to know it’s okay to feel the way you feel. You don’t need to be scared, of course, you’re overwhelmed or stressed, I mean who wouldn’t? But it’s important to know that when you feel that way you should do a little self-care, such as taking a bath for example? You deserve to feel at ease and relaxed. 

And if you are somewhere in between I hope you know that you’re so strong for breathing despite the pain, I know you will make it :) I believe in you. All I want for you is to stay here, I really mean all my words, even if there is a lot of unsaid things I want to tell u and my text is getting longer and longer, I want you here. 



I hope one day your smile will become a genuine one where you don’t need to fake it anymore because I can’t say this enough, you deserve a good smile and to feel alive. You’re worth more than every fucking cent in this world.

I just turned 19 on the 8 of december but i didn’t care about my birthday at all. I got into my first relationship ever on my 18th birthday I had never touched a girl before or anything. So she made me discover all the great things about love, about not being alone everyday all the good stuff. We broke up after 7months, it was all my fault. Now, i can’t enjoy my birthday again.

I'm leaving this to whoever who feel sad, depressed, useless, and broken at the moment



I know, that it is hurt to breathe, and you probably just want everything to end already.

It's not your fault, stop blaming yourselves.

Be happy, move on, smile is a tough task, and you might assume that it is impossible to do, well it is.



But you will be healed later, you will be happy, your smile will rise and your laughter will be echoing all over the room once again.

Healing indeed takes time, it could be weeks, months, or even years.

Whoever, whenever, and wherever you are, I pray for your happiness.
You will be happy, no, we will be happy.

I lost myself while trying to please everyone else, when I try to please myself I lost everyone, the only one person who came to me on the lowest point of my life left me now, I can't feel anything anymore, sometimes I feel that my mom didn't deserve to pass away, it should've been me, I can't keep going anymore, I'm tired, god, do I really deserve this, I've been hurt enough from people that walk away from my life, and I feel that I've lost enough people who will never come back. God please say something, you know my heart is fragile, why did u shattered it everytime when I'm almost fully healed my heart, I can't feel anything anymore, when she ask for a breakup, I feel nothing, but I don't want her to go and ask her to stay, beside the point I can't make her stay if she didn't want to stay. dear god please be easy on me, I'm tired already, I'm also scared to die, mom I really miss you, some words are unspoken, I regret for not visiting you the day that suppose to be the last day we met. some words are unspoken, some love aren't yet to be completed. dear god, if you really want to make me strong, guide me to where you want me to be. dear god, I love you.

I didn't know depression would hit me hard to the point of not going out of my room because we live in a toxic world where people people laugh at us because we are fat. Feeling ugly everyday?? feeling like I will never be successful. like my life was meant to be a mocking shit. that I hate myself every day. I hope I get out of this thing soon because I think of suicide every time I'm alone. wishing I was a different person everyday if I had a chance to go back to choose whether I should be born or not I wouldn't choose to be born. if you have any fat friend or relative don't say anything that can offend them because even jokes hit hard. please let's avoid this

Although I did not suffer as much as the rest, but every day they ignore me as if I were a shadow and I cannot eat well. The only thing that takes me out of reality is anime, but now I cannot feel joy from it, and those who were like my brothers have become hating me and every day my condition worsens. I cannot overcome them. They are the only ones who bring joy to me. And whenever I wanted to talk to someone, they ignored me and forced me not to cry, nor to be a mask of happiness. Encouraging words for you, my friend, do not last. 1 Cry when you want to cry 2 In order to overcome that you want to harm yourself, play your favorite series or anime with your favorite food, do not deprive yourself, you do not deserve to hate yourself 3 Go out to the beach and look at the sea with your favorite juice 4 positive friends to change you for the better 5 I love you, do not cry, you are strong, you are legendary, do not stop, achieve your goals, then you will I feel that you are  feel unparalleled happiness I feel that you are strong and achieve it so that I love you love you love you????

Honestly, thank you for this playlist. I've been struggling with depression. Everyday I feel so alone. I'm very insecure of myself, and I'm just losing more and more of myself. The only people that are keeping me alive are my online friends, but sometimes they hurt me without realizing it. It's funny how life goes, never knowing what will come crashing down onto you. I'm only 13, turning 14. I shouldn't even be feeling this way. I just feel like such a burden especially towards my family, It's surprising how they haven't given up on me yet. It's odd, how people hurt you, yet you can't stand losing them either. Honestly, I'm not afraid of losing all hope, I'm only afraid about hurting my family. But, every time I read these comments, it somehow wells up tears in my eyes, and gives me comfort. I've realized there is always hope in this world, no matter how difficult it may seem. Thank you for the people who care....

I'm don't understand the words of this music but I feel it
Deep in my poor heart I feel it warm

It's been 8 years since I start to have dark though and even suicidal's sometimes
But I'm still here

Every morning getting up to work
Saying I'm fine and smile to my boss
But when I come back to home
Alone 
I can't help me but crying over I'm not worthy of this life who's been given to me 
And recently I listen to this music until I sleep
And the next morning I got the strength to get up 

One day things will be better and I need to staying alive to feel it

Dear person that's reading this, keep on going ?. There is so much for you in this world and it's okay to feel sad. You are beautiful and you can get through this. No matter what you are going through, there will be people who love you and be with you; you will meet new people along the way too. Don't put yourself down or hurt yourself, it will get better, I promise. Even if life seems hopeless and everything is crumbling, be yourself and let your emotions out! Don't let them build up inside you and erupt. Cry if you need to and scream if it will help. Please, keep trying, for yourself and for those who love you and will love you in the future ?

Your neck isn't a coat, don't hang it

Your body isn't a book, don't judge it

Your life isn't a movie, don't end it

Your heart isn't a door, don't lock it

Remember to always love yourself no matter what you come against

(This is not my word, I'm spreading it to the 1% and now its your turn)?



Skyblock teaches us that no matter how ridiculous the odds may seem, within us resides the power to overcome these challenges and achieve something beautiful. That one day, we'll look back at where we started and be amazed by how far we've come. ~Technoblade

don't end your life, you'll just regret it when you realize. there is nothing worse than losing it. remember that people DO love you and you just might not realize.

life is not about being happy. Suffering is a part of the experience life is a tug of war between tragedy and perseverance. Your ability to recognize this moment isn't forever things will get better makes you stronger, because tragedy will strike again. And you can't just let it take you out. Happiness comes as a side effect of making the right choices when it's the hardest.

Hey everyone listening to this playlist, I know not many will read this, but I need to get this off my chest. So my life was always great, fun filled no real sadness expect for short one hour moments and at most a week or two. However a couple of months ago (around when summer vacation started) my mental health started to decline, for a while I didn't notice but it was growing. Eventually I came out as trans to my parents, it didn't go well. I would go to bed sad every night, and well, it still happens to this day. It started to get better, but something really tragic happened, my dog, Ruby (R.I.P)?? I know she lived a long loving life, but it still hurts, I miss her so much. I can barely focus on anything, I don't even know how I am going to present tomorrow because I know I will stutter. I'm scared, it feels like my life is crumbling before me, I wish the pain could go away, I wish I could live each day without being paranoid of everyone around me, afraid... I've honestly lost myself, I miss the good days, playing on my laptop, playing Roblox, I miss it.

Remember, every day is a chance to start all over again from scratch. If something didn't work out, try to do it again. If you like the business that you are doing, then keep doing it even if everyone tells you that it is not possible, but in this life there is nothing impossible, because we live only once and we need to try everything in this life.

A friendly reminder to people who came here to cry . Just believe in urself and don't trust anyone unless there efforts touch ur soul . Everyone are temporary don't expect or wait for others to console u . U can do it urself. Just have a good cry and stop expecting and just go with the flow and see where the life leads u . Lead ur life by urself boldly. U r not lonely u r just alone that's all... Realise the difference . Stay alone and push the loneliness away . It's ok . Healing will take time just wait .... And don't expect anything from others . I hope this message would help u atleast little . Love u all ??

I don't feel loved by family or friends, just want to experience love atleast once, even if it's just a little moment and never again idc, i can stay depressed and alone for the rest of my life. 

I don't have many friends and i'm antisocial so it's hard to make friends with people, but hey.. I'm trying and you should to.. don't give up, you're not alone, we love everyone the same, we love you!

I've had to many people in my life lose their life's through suicide and just passing away.
And honestly I feel awful that I've attempted it myself, but you do not have to feel ashamed for what you are feeling!
YOU MATTER!. 
Speak to someone please, if you leave this world there WILL be someone that will cry themselves to sleep to this playlist wishing they had only taken the time to listen, or thought of what they could have done to save you. A mother, father, brother, sister, cousin, friend, best friend etc that will sit up late at night looking through all the memories of you they have left of you, smelling that t shirt hoping the smell of you doesn't go away to..there will  be someone blaming themselves and maybe even doing the same thing.

 It is not worth throwing such a precious life away.

 when you sleep at night and wake up with no more tears and you get up and try again, my hopes are that you are glad you didn't do what you thought to do. 
I WISH with all my heart that I could say all this to my lost friends and family member  and so I really really appreciate you taking the time to read my message ?? I pray for your safety, and I love you ??????

Whenever im feeling sad/depressed and suicidal, I think of my younger self and I talk with them. And yes, it might be a bit crazy, but it has helped me a lot. I remember when I was immature and naive. I thought being mature was great and wanted to be that way and didn’t think once about enjoying childhood and the freedom and innocence that came with it. Now everything is different. 
Stay safe guys! If you need help, try to reach out to people who can help. Remember that even though the world can be cruel, most people aren’t. (I know this might spark a huge debate, but I believe people are better than we give them credit for) stay safe! ?

To anyone who needs this: I love you. No, I am not saying this to make you feel better, I really need you, your family needs you, your classmates need you, your friends need you. Your smile makes more smiles, your laughter make more people laugh, your happiness makes other people happy. The same can be said for your pain and tears. Whatever it is that is making you like this, just know it will be over soon. Trust me you will be ok. Some people may not like you and make you feel the way you’re feeling, but remember, where there is shadows, there is light. You may have some light hidden away, you just need to find it and forget the shadows. If you are thinking about doing (unaliving yourself) don’t, I beg you. ??

I've suffered so much my whole little life. I dont wanna
Grow up
Why cant I just die 
Why is sadness a thing
Why does everyone hate me 
Why do I exist 
Am I worth it
Am I useful
Why am I a waste of empty space
Those are a few of the questions that keep me up i always think i deserve everyone's sadness and pain no one deserves to suffer like me. I'm so scared to be alone but to be around people I wish I could have attention but never to much
I wish had more than 2 friends but not more than 3. I wish people could understand me.
I feel to sad to realize how many people suffer like me. I feel like I ruin peoples  life to try help myself. I'm so alone and mad...at myself for being like this.
I belive
You deserve better and to  not suffer 
You need help and I can try to help
You are the best and  no one can tell you what to do
You are yourself and no one else you are not a waste of space you are helpful and you matter to so many lives
You are loved by so many people just ignore what people say just dont care about thos words
You are the best and you have alot of people to support you!
I wish I could say that to myself but I hope you have a good day ok? Dont let sadness ruin your life like it ruined mine
You can change
I belive in you 
I hope you understand 
It warms my heart but also makes my heart sad to know there are so many deppressed people like me 
If you are still here you replaced one of my sad tears to a happy one and hopefully I did that to you too
You deserve better ok? Have a good day and life
Trust me everything people say is not true what's true are the complements and the good words I hope
This helped you look to the good side and be happy 
I know its hard but hard work pays of
Just like you I'm struggling but maybe we can both find a good side with happiness 
Please have a awsome life, to that random person I dont know I hope I helped.  you are a good person
You dont need to like or reply to this you are just a good person with a warm heart 
Thank you for reading here are some high fives for you??? and some love???????? and some tissues for your tears?????? have a good day ok?
From: a unknown person like you
I guess all my hard work means nothing..as usual :(

I'm about 15 y/o now. I also wish i can be a kid again. When I was a kid, I didnt have to worry about anything, school wasn't not as stressful, and my family have many times to eat dinner together. But now I  have to worry about a lot of things, exams and homeworks is too much and I often have to wake up until 2 a.m. to do all the homework, i dont even have free time. Also I have problem with socialising so my classmates don't really talk much to me and I feel really stressful. My family also now spend less time together, my parents leaves home in the early morning, and goes home at nearly midnight, or they can't even go home. Listening to this give me powers, it makes me leave the painful reality, and just simply enjoy the melodies, I cried a lot listening to this playlist. Thank you for uploading this playlist

I'll tell my story too, i have been listening to this playlist since this summer cuz i was left alone by my friends because they were preparing partys without me. That means that they have been talking about the parties that they were gonna make and then when i ask them "what are you talking about?" They were saying me "oh nothing important dont worry".And then the weekend after they did the party, they would talk about this and told me the good moments that happened. Plus, at almost the end of school year my friend has his birthday. They had prepared another party for him. And again they never told me any infomation about it. So because of that, i never said "happy birthday Esteb( cuz his name was esteban)" then after that i was scared to talk to him cuz i thinked that i wasn't a good friend and that he was gonna do something bad to me. Besides, i failed my high school first year( biggest mistake of my life) and now its just hard to see that my friend have new friends and that they dont seem to give a fuck about me anymore. Thanks for reading my story.

My dear friends, if you ever feel like things aren't going to get any better, I promise they will. Please don't starve, hurt, or abuse yourself in anyway. Don't say that you don't matter, you are worth every minute you breathe on this earth. Take a moment to reflect on what you can do to make yourself feel happy, enjoy the things that please you. Take it from me, a guy who understands your pain. Take care friends. ????

"Your neck is not a coat, so don't hang it" 

"Your face is not a book, so dont judge it"

"Your life is not a movie, so dont end it"
But use your skin as paper to draw your own story,
Your neck to hold up your head when you feel you cant hold the pressure,
Your face to smile at those who are feeling down,
And live your life to the fullest, make it a movie you'll want to replay, and dont press pause.

to the person reading this,



It’s been hard for you, I know, and it makes me sad that you don’t see yourself in the way I see you. Sometimes they are things in life that cause us to lose ourselves, and the way you have is so unimaginable painful. I miss your smile, the way your eyes light up the whole room just by the sound of your laughter. I miss the way you accepted the way you look in the mirror without cursing yourself out about how ugly you look. I miss the way you didn’t think of yourself as a failure because everyone makes mistakes, we all have flaws and we all aren’t perfect. It’s painful to see that no one around you seems to see the pain through your eyes, but, stranger, I do, I see how heavy your heart is and how comforting the sadness for you might be, how afraid your heart is of happiness because it disappears in the end, right? You don’t know how much impact you have in this world and it’s sad to see that your demons fight against you and want to take over you. Because you do make a change, it’s something so simple and little that brightens up someone’s whole world, it can be a small smile from your lips, the way you look at things you’re passionate about, the way you make yourself eat even though it’s been hard for you lately, the way you zoom out and go in your own world, you brighten up my world by reading this, it means a lot to me that you’re here, existing, but I don’t want you to just exist, you deserve to feel alive. You deserve to get up in the morning and feel good about yourself. You deserve to feel something- to feel every damn second alive in this lifetime. It’s heartbreaking that you think you’re not capable of being loved because you are, I love you through all my words and I hope you let it happen in your heart. Love is scary, I know, maybe your heart had been broken once and since then you wanted to be rather numb than feel ever again, it hurts me how you punish yourself, does it not deserve love? Because YOU DO deserve love, please forgive yourself, it’s not your fault that the demons want to take over your beautiful heart. You’re not a bad person for distancing yourself from others, but you deserve someone to talk to, you deserve someone to listen. I am listening, you can tell me what’s wrong. It’s everything, isn’t it? There’s something pulling your heartstrings on the ground and no one seems to understand how misunderstood you feel, it’s heartbreaking to know that I am behind the screen and can’t give you a hug, that’s why I will give you a big warm virtual hug and send you lots of love :). You matter. You are worthy. You are loved. You deserve good things. You deserve someone to listen. You deserve to eat and drink. You deserve to feel good and alive. You deserve to smile. You deserve a hug. You deserve to be all the things you want to be because you deserve to have and feel good things happening to you and have a fulfilled life. I know I might not know you personally but I care about you so much, I write this because I want you to stay here with me, I want you to hold on a little longer because you matter so much to me, because I will not let you give up on yourself. I want you to see that you should not give up on yourself because you DESERVE GOOD THINGS. I want you to look back on the time when you were a kid, you didn’t give up when you tried to swim for the first time, you didn’t give up when you tried to walk for the first time and fell, you never gave up on yourself, you always kept on pushing forwards, so why can’t you now? I know it’s tiring, your mentally tired, but don't your younger self deserve good things? look back at your eyes that used to be full of hope, look back on those dreams. Don’t let yourself fall, you deserve better. We will both fight, I will fight for you. I won’t let those demons get to you. You can hold on to me, I won’t let you down :). Whenever you feel lonely, then look at the sky, I always look at it and think about you. Yes, you, because it makes me happy that there’s someone looking right back, maybe we can’t see each other but I can feel your presence here with me and that’s enough for me because I am glad your heart is beating and you’re still fighting. You’re so much stronger thank you think, you didn’t leave your spot on this earth even if you wanted to, you belong here, even though it doesn’t feel like it when you don’t feel like belonging then build your own home here, put all your love in it and dreams. Think of you as a star when you feel alone, you shine because your heart is good, no matter what mistake you made, no matter about the past you had, you’re one of the stars that shine bright in the universe because you’re heart is beautiful, that’s why the demons in your mind want to have it. As one of the stars you see other stars, maybe they have felt the same way as you do at some point in their life, but they lighten up the universe with each other’s presence. You’re a star for me, maybe you don’t see it yourself but I can see it, you’re beautiful from inside and out, your body is beautiful the way it is. You make me happy by reading this, you make me feel something by your presence, and when you can make me feel that way then you also make other people feel that way about you too. I hope you stay for yourself and don’t let your story get written by others but by yourself, it’s your story, not theirs. As you can see, I say a lot of “I hope” because I have hope for you even if you don’t have it for yourself, I see hope in you even though you might want to give up. That’s why I hope you won’t see the world in darkness and will see it colorful again, I hope I will give you a glimpse of hope and make the world you see a bit colorful for today. My favorite color is yellow, and I hope the next time you see the color yellow you will think about my words. If someone left you then don’t blame yourself, don’t think you weren’t enough, don’t lower yourself for someone who couldn’t see the awesomeness in you. If you lost someone I am so sorry for your loss, they want you happy, I hope you don’t feel guilty or regret because you were there, you spend enough time with them, they want you to be happy. They are in a good and safe place now. If someone broke your heart then I am so sorry that they couldn’t see the way you look so beautiful because of the heart you have. Anyone who gets to be with you doesn’t know how fucking lucky he/ she/ they are :). If you aren’t accepted at home or in general then I am so sorry that you have to deal with someone/ something you shouldn’t be ashamed of, I accept you and support you, I accept you as a human being no matter what race, religion, nationality, skin color, or sexuality you have. You’re safe here with me :). You’re not useless, you’re not a burden to anyone. You’re not a problem, you’re human and your feelings are valid. You’re not being dramatic. Please don’t starve yourself, you deserve food and to drink, I know it’s hard. It hurts to see that you’re in so much pain :( you deserve so much man, don’t let your emotions control you. Don’t let them get the best of you.  I am sorry no one is noticing, I wish /hope I could take your pain away for today or even for a moment while you’re reading this. If no one told you, I am so proud of you, you’re reading this and it’s enough for me to be proud of you because you’re here and that’s all that matters to me. If it’s the night for you, go to sleep, I know it’s hard to fall asleep right now but you deserve a good sleep. If you have nightmares, please, don’t let them fight you. If it’s the day for you, don’t start it with such sad music, I know it’s impossible to have a good day with such a mindset but take baby steps, start by drinking two cups of water every day in the morning, and so on. You will start building little healthy habits. If it’s the evening for you, you’re probably overwhelmed and stressed, I want you to know it’s okay to feel the way you feel. You don’t need to be scared, of course, you’re overwhelmed or stressed, I mean who wouldn’t? But it’s important to know that when you feel that way you should do a little self-care, such as taking a bath for example? You deserve to feel at ease and relaxed. 

And if you are somewhere in between I hope you know that you’re so strong for breathing despite the pain, I know you will make it :) I believe in you. All I want for you is to stay here, I really mean all my words, even if there is a lot of unsaid things I want to tell u and my text is getting longer and longer, I want you here. 



I hope one day your smile will become a genuine one where you don’t need to fake it anymore because I can’t say this enough, you deserve a good smile and to feel alive. You’re worth more than every fucking cent in this world.



You can let go for today, I got you, you can cry your heart out as much as you want, but don’t let it tear you down and let your emotions control you by giving up. Crying is not a weakness. If you still feel alone I dedicate you to a song as your friend.

“Dusk till Dawn- Zayn feat. Sia (I prefer the slow version)” I hope you can think of me and will remind yourself of my words, I will for sure think of you. 



In case no one told you and you’re unsure yourself, you’re a good person and I am so happy you’re here. 



I hope this is enough to stay today, tomorrow will be a new day, a new start, let go now. Enough with beating yourself up for today, okay? 



Life for those who couldn’t smile for those who forgot what a genuine smile is, love like there’s no other, hug-like it's your last one. 



If you read all of it, until tomorrow my friend :) 

have a good day and a great year.

Not mine but u can spread it :)

I don’t know about anyone else, but when I’m crying the worst thing people can do is try to make me laugh or be happy. When I cry I want to cry. I’m here to tel you that I’m here for you over a simple YouTube comment. I know it’s hard right now. I know you want to give up. I know you think no one understands. But I do. I see you. I believe in you. I understand. I know people don’t understand and it seems like they don’t care about you. But the amount of people that you make happy. The people who smile when they think of you. When you smile, their day gets better. Those are the people to keep going for. Even if you don’t realize who they are or you even think they exist, they do. And they love you even if you don’t always feel it. There is always another day, so keep going till the next one. I know it’s sad right now, but your happy ending is coming, I promise. God loves you and so do I ???

I hate how I don’t cry
But it feels so right

I hate the feeling of express
But I want it to help me be at rest

I hate the thought of an notion
But I feel as if it could be my emotions

I AM SO ANGRY
I could scream but no one is present

My future is unknown
But my past is in my home

I try to run for the hills
But every time I land in the grave fields

Love is depressing
Pain is the message

Suffering is the peace
Sadness is my relief

Why? Just why?
I don’t know why

Why is the product of hate
Hate is the product of the unknown

The unknown is the subscript of my miserableness
While I’m sad about the distances

What am I saying
I don’t even know

I’m so confused
Why am I so confused

Can someone help me
Please 

I don’t have a plea
But I’m not sure what I have

Can we make a deal
Let me know asap

I’m silenced silent

When I speak I’m abandoned
And when I’m silent I’m hidden

Our cry for help rejected, learning facilities neglected, hearts dejected

by circumstance, nobody saw our anger. 

Danger followed,
murder hollowed bodies because they failed to listen.

Intentions misunderstood due to malignant intuition.

Sentences issued, toy soldiers locked away to decay from inside out, doubt filled our world without drought. 

Certainty never came.

Red rain beating the roof of a house where hurt and pain resides.

Memorials raised, pictures depicting fertile thoughts that strayed,
then died. 
All we ever heard from the public was 
why. 

Debating facts
and fantasy as our world collides.

Spoken but not heard with hate fused inside

From the pallid walls my voice emanates, it elucidates our struggle

It depicts frustration and rage from when our voices were muffled

When no one listened or cared, feelings never were spared, so hearts resembled prunes. 

Violence ensued leaving too many cold and blue.

Blood red tears cascaded down the cheeks of momma’s face,
she cried as she consoled her baby with her last loving embrace.

But couldn’t explain the reason why?

It is time for a change. It is time for people to stop looking back, and saying," Life is the worste anyone can see." It is time to start going forward and  break the wall. Life will be hard, you just got to push out of it and keep going! NEVER look back only if it is a good reason. A reason of a day in your life that is happy joyfully and compassionately great full.

I'm tired. Always demanding this and that. I'm desperate to live. It's been going on for almost 4 years but why do people who hurt me stay calm? They don't feel guilty for what they did? I was born in a family that didn't have anything, my parents had very big egos My parents didn't care about the future of their last child, I was constantly sick and hurt No one cares about me even though I told my story thousands of times. I am 16 years old now, I dropped out of school because of violence by my teacher I dropped out of school since elementary school. I want to be like them, educated, happy, but what can I do? I don't even have anyone I can talk to, my family can't even help me. Those who hurt me also don't care about my future, they really don't care. I want justice for myself I can't even sleep peacefully because I'm still in fear, depression and trauma are still in my mind. I don't have friends, I only have family who also can't do anything because of limited funds. Is there someone who can help me? I am completely desperate to live Help me I'm literally living with a dead soul :( I don't know who to turn to for help Please help me please contact me I come from Indonesia.

Hey there.



What are you doing here so late?



Can't sleep?









Ah. Coming to cry in the middle of the night.



I get that.



It feels nice to do that, so I understand.



Take all the time you need.











You know, I just happened to find you stumble upon the video where I'm taking a break.



Wanna sit down for a while?



Tell me about what's bothering you?





Oh, don't worry about me. I don't find you annoying.



I wanna be here for you.



I'll try to help as best as I can.



I won't judge you. Everyone has their own story.















Ah, that sucks.



I can't begin to imagine how you must feel.



You're so tough for getting through all of that.



I'm so proud of you for not giving up.





Of course I understand.



One broken soul to another.









I just want to remind you.



No matter how hard it gets, please stay strong.



Take care of yourself.



You can't go into a battle already wounded.



You can't wave the white flag without trying your hardest.



This will all be over soon.







And hey.



If you ever need to take another break, I'm always here.



Helping people is my specialty.



They always find their way, one way or another.



You can come sit down with me any time.



I'll try to lend some advice, or just an ear to listen.







And if this is your last time visiting me, I'm proud of you.



My job is done.



Go take on life with all your energy, and remember that you have one soul always cheering you on.



You'll always have my support.



I can't wait to see the great things you'll achieve.







Before you go...







I love you. <3

it's 2022. why do I still remember the people who once gave me joy and disappointment. 2 years 7 months 10 days 45 minutes 8 seconds the person together with me arrived.Time I should try to forget it. That person left a very deep wound in my love history. Sad, painful, sick, disappointed and sometimes forcing yourself to be happy even by yourself. Know that you cannot live without it Time passed too quickly. If given the chance, I will increase the period of 2 years with him to forever Until the last breath. I still love that person and can't lie to myself anymore. I'm waiting for that person to come back. I promise myself.

Just make your promise yourself that whatever is causing to cry and feel hurt just don't let it drag you down every single one of you are amazing and strong in your own way keep strong guys ??

When I was young I used to be beat up by my parents bcs in school I was always pulling pranks since I wanted attention, always wanted them to show me love but they kept ignoring me, i had to develop myself, always felt lonely, my 2 brother used to reject me bcs I wasn't the brother they wanted, I spent all my life trying to win their approval, and wishing that I would just grow up and it would go away, I'm 19 now and I don't really know what to do, I feel more lost then ever, a part of me wants to push forward but the other just wants to end it all. 

Ty for anyone who saw this, sharing takes a little bit of the weight out of my shoulders.

And i thought i loved her with all my hopes and dreams neglected . All my childhood friends gone , only for that girl . She was my sunshine she was keeping me warm at night . 18 hour calls , having fun in many exciting ways . She looks at me and says " I love you " . She tells you " I wish our children would look like you " . She tells you " that she will forever stay with you that she is your only one . and yet its all gone to fucking hell . No love . No hope . Nothing . Just this empty feeling . Of regret , of the amount of flowers bought , of the dreams we had . All burned to ashes . She was texting 3 other guys the same.... So I knew i wasnt the only one

Anyone listening to this and feeling bad about themselves- always remember you're an amazing person and anything anyone's ever gonna say isn't going to change your personality or the fantastic person you are. There are at least 15 people in the world who love you so much they'd die for you and I hope you remember that whatever this world throws at you, you're gonna overcome it because even if you fall, someone's gonna help you up because you are FABULOUS. Never forget that and don't let anybody bring you down. :) Hope you have a great day xoxo :)

Honestly, I'm just tried of feeling like shit. Suffered with depression for nearly 7 years now (ATM I'm at the age where I can drive but I'm not an actual adult in the U.S). It doesn't even make me sad, kinda just numb and it pisses me off, I get aggressive when I feel numb and currently I'm with someone (Highschool relationship. Yeah ik that ain't gonna last long, but its nice to dream.)
You got big media hiding good news like how scientists found a way to "cure" blindness but it was covered up during the pandemic. My mother is currently on a flight back to where I live after vacationing to Hawaii. Kinda worried about that.
Then Freedom of speech is getting censored. Which..I believe gen Z is gonna end that entirely because those born after 2008 can't take anything like, I'm so tired of their stupid complaints.
No joke got called transphobic because I didn't know someone's name, and because I didn't know they were trans.
I wanna do stuff but can never end up doing it.

To anyone reading this while listening to this music, I know what you feel, you’re probably even crying right now, but whatever can happen to you is nothing compared to what you have accomplished and who you are. You are an amazing person and never let anyone make you feel otherwise. You might be having a bad time, but behind walls is always happiness. Have a great day/week/month/year and remember that nothing is worth loosing your life. ??

I always have to pretend for everybody, but I'm done pretending. I give up, I'm just going to ignore everybody.
Just know that if you aren't in middle school or high school yet, be prepared because, at least for me, middle school is hell and I barely made it past the second quarter. I've lost so many friend and had to deal with so much drama. My only friend left is toxic, but I can't bring myself to forget about her. Shes moving soon anyways so it shouldn't matter, but no matter how much of a bitch she is to me I stay her friend, and I've never been able to do that. I always just drop the shitty and toxic friends, but with her it's different with her. She's like a sister to me, no matter how much I want to hate her I can't. So I give up on life, and I hate myself. I don't want to die, but I also don't want to live. I always want to cry, but at this point I've cried all my tears out. Now all I can do is lay in bed wanting to cry. Just when I think my life is getting better, something or someone has to just go and fuck it up. Now I just have a never ending headache. The only thing I can do to make it better is to go in my room lay on my bed and sit there in silence, but even then the headache is still there. I barely get any sleep, I usually can't fall asleep until around 3 or 4 in the morning. I have to wake up at 6 in the morning every day for school. I'm on Christmas break know, and you would think that would make it better. It honestly doesn't it just makes it worse, because then I'm aloud to lay in be and do nothing. That leads to me overthinking everything, which is when I find a pair of scissors. That's why I have so many scars on my arm, and when people ask I just say I'm really clumsy.I was basically FORCED into a relationship with my best friend, and now we broke up. So I lost my guy best friend, I mean we both liked each other but if I'm being honest I know realize the only reason I liked him was because he was nice and a good person. That was my expectation, not that I actually liked them, but that they were a good person. That's just sad, and the saddest part is that if I had realized that sooner, maybe just maybe we still would've been friends. Hanging out with him was the only good part of my life, the only thing left of him is a panda stuffy he gave me for my birthday. His little sister loved me, and now, well I haven't seen his sister since we broke up. The shittiest part of it all is that he's in EVERY SING ONE OF MY CLASSES. I mean really can it get any shittier than that, you have to see the one person that gave you true happiness EVERY SINGLE FUCKING DAY. So everyday I have to go through the feeling I felt when I first lost him. Now the only feelings of happiness I have are fake, just a show I put on. But I'm FUCKING DONE PRETENDING. It's draining, taking the only energy I have. So I'm done pretending.

" We grew up children wishing to be adults... As adults we wish to be children " 

It's sad that people usually under the age of 18 have to go through shit like this " broken hearts " That's shitty as fuck " depression" still shitty " especially the whole anxiety thing people go through so much stupid shit that life throws at you. Your not alone sometimes when I see shit on the news it just makes me wanna go into my bed stuff myself under the covers & grab a pillow just to cry the whole night. Sometimes it even feels like i can't breathe like in stuck under water & nones gonna help... Sry if this seemed a bit dramatic but ppl have to go through horrible shit & if you're wondering yes I am above the age of 16 I'm 19... I'm just shocked that we grew up as children thinking growing up is fun... Please children listening to this right now whatever your going through it's only going to get worse so just enjoy childhood as it is...

I just broke up with the love of my life and this song or Playlist whatever you call it just hits hard and we'll they were right I'm crying my eyes out I havnt slept for hours. And I think it's true we taught life would be fun we taught that being 16 would be fun cause you're almost a grownup. Wel if there is children younger that 16 don't get your hopes up.

14 Million views... it hurts to see so many are going through this shit. I wish everyone luck with their battles and their journeys <3

I can't tell you it's going to get better unfortunately because everyone's circumstances are different, I know it's a struggle right now, But I personally believe depression can be beaten, It just feels like it gonna take more work than what you can put out. 

if you can't go day by day, live from second to second, do things that used to make you happy, focus on things other than what your brain is saying, live life even when it feels like you can't..

If no one is there for you, if it feels like no one wants you around, just take one second, that's all I ask, one second to think about what you can do instead of ending it. and I know that's easier said than done, but I believe in you <3

for whoever is reading this, You've got this!

and I'm happy to talk if you need that too <3

Good luck with your personal turmoil's and battle's, I'm rooting for you!

"We live, in fact, in a world starved for solitude, silence, and privacy: and therefore starved for meditation and true friendship." -C.S. Lewis.

I would like to add for this love, caring and understanding.

But that doesn't mean we should stop trying to find love and happiness. Even if our childhood was messes up.
Jut how many well known and succesfull people had a horrible childhood?
Never give up, or all of your suffering, tears, dreams and efforts were for nothing.
This world needs, more than ever, a lot of people who can understand and KNOW just how important and needed love is.

I'm one of them, and I keep continue to live, fight, and bring a better world with however I can.
So please, join me. - Rebeka Doczi.

Everyone’s comments are amazing. But no one should be having to go through any heartbroken state in their lives, It just only ruins their mind set and makes them overthink. Everyone’s a good human being and if your losing someone you really much loved that was your first then that’s okay. You have some really good memories and some bad. But having the good memories and bad is what makes us human and feeling these ways is what makes us human and what’s lovely about everyone is that everyone’s human and we sometimes can’t deal with the damage alone and need someone to talk to.

I missed a person I pushed away though I love him so much. And I probably will never find another one like him. I’m just not worth all his love and I will never worth being loved by someone. My facade is with me all the time. Every time I took it off, things get out of control. But it will be fine, I will find someone who will truly love me as who I am. Finding that person starting from my self.

To whoever is reading this, yes. It is okay to sulk in and embrace your sadness sometimes. We don't have to keep it inside ourselves all the time, you're doing great. Just because you're sad at this moment doesn't mean it'll last forever, you have the right to be sad. There is a reason we feel it, we need sadness to be happy. Without sadness we're empty, you're doing yourself a favor by just... being sad sometimes, just fully embracing it. It's okay, whatever is going on, you'll make it through. Just trust me on this one... ok?

Was für eine Zeit. Wir schniefen, husten schnaufen. Wir laufen von Einkauf zu Einkauf nur um zu sehen, was es alles nicht gibt. Wir arbeiten und sehen kein Land, weil die Zeit so knapp zu sein scheint. Wir denken so viel an das was wir noch brauchen, ohne oft zu sehen, was wir haben. Und genau die kleinen Zeitfenster und Momente, die wir verweilen, sind das schöne, wo wir uns zurücklehnen können. Ich kann das oft hier auf Youtube, wenn ich mir die Videos in der so wunderbar kleinen Youtuber Gemeinde ansehe. Für mich immer ein Moment um wieder zu schmunzeln ja zu lachen, mitzudenken oder einfach nur unterhalten zu sein. Ganz lieben Dank für die immer schönen Emotionen. Ich wünsche ein tolles Wochenende und einen schönen 4. Advent Vibes.

Just because you have something happen to you in life doesn’t mean you should be sad but it might be you lowest point in life and I understand that but you are letting it hurt you so promise me that you will never let it over come you and you get up and do something to help like go hangout with your friends but if that is not possible then something that helps me mentally and physically is working out I just got broke up with so I decided to work out and it paid off so I feel better so can you promise me get up and get something done so you feel better about your self !!! So please don’t forget what i said and please don’t be sad or mad you will feel better soon I promise but hopefully you get through this and you can feel better ????????

I’ve been with my ex for 6 years, she was the love of my life. She cheated and left me because I was to focused on chasing my dream as a pro boxer. She was my number #1 supporter but overtime I trained more than be with her. I don’t know what to do anymore because she was there when I first started at 14 and now I have no reason to keep going cause the one that supported me isn’t there anymore at 20.

Hey to everyone reading this, I know life isn’t always the best, trust me, it sucks most of the time. No one can change that for you but yourself. So don’t let those people who are toxic into your life, cut them loose. It’s important to make sure YOU are happy before you can try and help others. And remember no matter how down things might look, there is always someone there for you, wether it’s a family member, a friend from work or school or your local stores, or some stranger you met on the internet. YOURE NOT ALONE


Edit*
So I saw that quite a few people responded to this and I’m sorry I can’t reply to y’all individually that would cause such a mess so I’m just gonna put it right here; I’m sorry to hear what y’all are going through but remember: if you commit die you’ll never have the chance to see how amazing your life might turn out. Change isn’t gonna come on it’s own, you gotta work for that, but when you do, you can create something beautiful for yourself. Also you gotta outlive your enemies, no?

Guys I’m sorry but I am in no way capable of answering your questions I’m 16

and I'm at home or something like that, it all comes out of me and I'm about to give up myself. Every day anew For 4 years I break myself every day anew, and no one is with me and helps me

everyone thinks i'm fine... but it's not like that... the last time i was happy... i just can't remember it... because so much has happened that i forget everything.

I've forgotten who I used to be or who I wanted to be...

(Hey babe, what's goin on?

Do you know that i cry myself to sleep at night
I wanna fuckin die, yuh go towards the light
No, i'm not tryna put up a fight
But you didn't need to be so uptight with me yuh
I dont wanna eat no mo’ (yeah)
I dont wanna drink no mo (yeah)
I don't wanna feel no mo’ (feel)
I don't wanna live, but i don't wanna die
You might think you’re his but i just wish you were mine

Why can't you just be mine? (mine)
I might look okay but inside i aint fine (fine)
He stole you from me, that shit’s a crime (crime)
Yuh, why can't you, why can't you just be


Why does this shit happen to me?
I used to be blind but now i can see
I need to cool the fuck down before i overheat, yuh
I just wish you could’ve been a keeper

Is it too late to decide?
Is it too late, should I be alive?
Maybe I really wanna die
I just wanna see the black in all this white
I really gotta sleep, but i cant close my eyes
I can't get over it, why the fuck can't I?
I don't wanna see no mo, oh
I dont wanna taste no mo, (what a fool)
I don't wanna hear no mo
Cuz I dont wanna hear another thought bout you
I'm staring at these walls, and i don't have time
You might think you’re his, I just wish you were mine (mine)

Why can't you just be mine? (mine)
I might look okay but inside i aint fine (fine)
He stole you from me, that shit’s a crime (crime)
Yuh, why can't you, why can't you, why can't you just be

Your blanket always listened 
Your covers always covered you
Your stuffed animals never judged you 
Welcome to this fake world ?? 
Never again will you feel this feeling 
Because it never happened 
Or so we thought ?? 
Your mother always listened 
Your friends always kept you stronger 
Your father always guided you
Welcome to this fake world ?? 
When this feeling always fades
Or have people never had this 
What is this feeling that fades 
Changes from time to time again and again 
That would be comfort 
The feeling you belong
When you know you are loved 
When you know you have the reassurance 
That you are supported
 But …Welcome to the fake world ??

The only thing separating us from our old self is our ways that you can always change Wich is what we do as we grow up because we think that it's going to make us a better person but something you should never change is yourself when some one else says that you need to its your own choice just choose the right path in life and that's what will make you a better person. So just remember be yourself and enjoy every moment of life because life is short so take Ind every moment and enjoy life to the fullest????????

I break my own heart every day.. Through bad choices and poor decisions. Repetition of the same cycles and routines. Holding myself back from a life I really want and deserve. Most days its just easier to just accept that maybe I'm not meant to be happy. Maybe I'm just "one of those people" who is supposed to suffer and endure suffering. Life is a continuous struggle and I seem to lose the battle every time, no matter how hard I fight. I'm getting tired. I often wonder whether I should just end my suffering here, but I can't do that to my family..I just can't accept that this is my life. I'm living a life that's not meant for me and grieving a life I never had.. It breaks my heart evert day.

Isn’t it funny how we feel nothing but yet cry to the painful memories these songs bring. Most of us will still feel as we did before after listening to this, but the truth is is that it is good to cry. These painful memories we have are cherished without us knowing it and as sad as it is…music is the only one who understands us and just lets us let ourselves go without having questions asked. It says screw the world and listen to me, I will comfort you. Whoever reads this, I don’t know what you are going through, break up, family issues, friend issues, relatives dying, etc… Music is our only outlet. I feel so numb and the saddest part is is that no one knows what I am feeling. It hurts….it really does

Its just when you have a girlfriend who you thought would be the one who loves you then turns out she likes your best friend then you go in your mind and figure out of how much love and effort you put and she ends you like that??

I thought she was the one ?? I opened my heart and that was my mistake. I should know better by know, I’m too old to be making these dumb mistakes. Sure I wanna find love but I’m done with the suffering, I’m done giving someone my all so they can brush off my efforts. I’m not complicated, I love with passion, I love with everything I got. Worst part it’s 3am and all I can think of is her, is she ok, is she warm, is she asleep, how’s she dealing with herself, is there already someone in my place. I just wish I could disappear

I lost my mom last year because of covid 19 and still can't get over it. I was very close to her and people keep telling me that she is still with me, but I can't feel her presence at all. I can't even feel my sadness anymore, actually I feel nothing at all, so I'm listening to sad songs to stimulate my feelings. I know nothing is going to get back to how it was before my mother's loss, but I'm trying so hard to not give up at this time. sorry for my bad English, I'm just having the worst days of my life and wanted to express my thoughts some where.

Flowers

Rainy Days

Blankets coming out of the dryer on a cold morning

New relationships

A nice cup of tea

Reading a good book

Drinking coffee on an early morning

The joy of being sarcacstic

Hidden talents

Small acomplishments

Adeventure

The mystery of the fog

The fantasy of going to never land

Baby showers

Weddings

The big blue ocean

Inside jokes with friends

Family reunions

walking around with colorful fuzzy socks

Being able to wear whatever you want around your house

The comfortable silence between two people

Doughnuts

snow ball fights

The tooth fairy

Jumping over waves

The pure laughter from someone

Star gazing

Being weird

Being diffrent

Being unqiue

The smell of coffee in the morning  

Writing Stories

2-3am talks with someone

Rollercoasters

Cookies

Completing a hard task

The sound of the fire cracking on a summers night

Naps

Walking in the words on a spring afternoon

Jumping in leaf piles

Climbing trees

The moments when you say " Did everyone see that? Cause I am not doing that again" 

The feeling of wrapping yourself in a fuzzy and soft blanket

The look of a made bed

Watching  the leaves fall

Long warm baths

The smell of fresh fruit

Waking up to no alarm clock

Never giving up

Seeing a double rainbow

Making one with your demons

Seeing the sunrise

Proving people worng

Being able to take risks

Being the light in every room that you walk into to, because no matter what people tell you you're amazing in every single way possible.

When i'm sad, i usually come to listen to these songs. Mainly because of my grandma who sadly passed away. And it hurt me to see my mom cry for the first time. I even heard her say to our house worker once "i may look fine from the outside, but i'm completely broken from the inside". Probably one of the saddest thing i've heard my mom say so far. Rest in peace grandma, i love you so much ??

Trying to grow my YouTube channel try to help my family anyway I can but it had stressed out a lot to the point of exhaustion, pain, anger, and depression. The worst thing to do is hard hiding your tears as to try to look tuff but sometimes you just got to let it out to let out all the mental pain you put yourself through

I am just sick of being tired because of my overthinking mind. I get tired without doing anything because i spend most of my time dwelling on things that happened or might happen. Writing this i literally have zero energy to do anything while i need to study because i have test after 3 days and i fear that this feeling might come before the night of my test. Truley speaking the only reason i am alive is because of my mother i feel like my dad or any one wouldn't be that botherd if i die and my mom will be happy if i score good results. She sacrificed many things for me and she loves me unconditionally the least i can do for her is be alive and study but its really hard i cant even cry anymore i just hate everything just why god why is this happening to me i feel like i am trapped surviving life i hate every fuvking thing about life life sucks

When you're failing in life because you don't feel like living and people get mad at you for not taking care of business. 
When you tell someone you are depressed, you cut, you don't want to live etc and they don't react like you need them to. Perhaps even saying you just want attention.
When you've given, up your tired you're angry hurt scared frustrated and you don't feel like you can keep going but you can't quite stop caring or living and get it over with. 
When you feel all alone and lost.
Turn up the volume, Look up the songs
"Hold on don't let go"
Laura story's "blessings"
Boyce cover song "will you be there"
From here to wherever you are across the globe. Let us listen together and cry. Then close your eyes and sleep. tomorrow as a new day. So beit if you fail or fall again. Let it out now and be at ease knowing that even though we don't know each other and we are not together you are not alone. My shoulder is there for you as well as my ear. My heart aches not just for you but with you because I am in the same boat literally suffering with you and crying inside too. God help us all.

It's Christmas eve. I think the last time I thought "this could end well" was when my dad tried to kill me at like 14 I'm sure there was more but that was the foot on my throat. It's not.like anything changed from before or after. Except for a brief moment I was with someone and I felt vernable. 

Other than that ita been pain.
That isn't to say it's all bad.
I like painting my cry for helps to see everyone ignore the message and it sure calls back to the song "you don't want to hear.... you just want to dance"

Many people here tell their stories, and damn, it brings us closer, even if we are just strangers.
I'll share mine too. I had a girlfriend, we were together for a long time, three and a half years, but eventually broke up. For six months I tried to get her back, constantly called, asked if everything was okay, adjusted to her, endured insults, cuz I thought I had a chance to get her back. Today she tell me that she found a boyfriend not so long ago, and she talked to me for fun. I've wasted 4 years of my life for this. I don't know what to do now. 
If you feel just as bad, for whatever reason, hold on. We all understand you.

Just here to vent... Broke up with my fiancé 3 months ago. People remind me that i am not my usual self. I dont know how to be that person anymore. Is there a solution? Or will time heal the pain? Kind of out of options for "pain" relieve. Maybe y'all know something??

Didn't i do everything she asked me to to change my ways? Didn't i move State for her so we could live closer to her folks? Didn't i quit and left everyone and everything i had and knew to be with her. Wasnt i the son in law her parents wanted? Always making sure everyone was accomodated? Didn't i pick her up everytime she fell down? Allways made her laugh through the tears we shed. Im i that bad of a person to deserve the loneliness im going through right now? I dont think i am.

There was a girl in my school. She wasn't popular. She didn't talk much but it wasn't because she was shy. She was quite the character (a little weird and really funny if I'm being honest but she was the sweetest girl I have ever met). I wasn't too close to her but I did talk to her quite a lot last year, since we were sat next to each other in Bialogy class. I remember every lesson she would offer me a cup of coffee from her flask because I was always complaining about how tired I was and that I just wanted to go home and sleep during the lesson.

I broke up with my girlfriend at the time. I was in a very bad place with my mental state. I was really depressed and even drinking myself to sleep. I reached out to her and she was there and she checked up on me a lot after, making sure that I was okay. She really helped me and forever I will thank her for it. A year passed and we grew distant. I barely talked to her this year.

Last month (15th September 2020) I had a feeling that something was off with her. The way that she seemed whenever I saw her in school. I texted her if she was feeling alright. She replied with the words, "i'm not sure, which is okay. thank you for trying to ask however. :)"

That girl took her life today on the 15th of October 2020 at the age of 16.

I haven't been able to stop thinking about it. I feel guilty for two reasons. One reason being that we grew distant over the passed year and that I didn't keep talking with her. The other reason being that maybe if I took the tiniest bit of time out of my day just to ask how she was everyday just like she did for me - that maybe, she would be alive. The guilt that I carry will be with me until the day I die. I would give anything to take it back and help her poor soul. I wish l'd known.

"The saddest people smile the brightest. The most damaged people are the wisest. All because they do not wish to see anyone else suffer the way they do." 

Rest easy, Anastasia. God will take care of you. I hope you find the happiness that you truly deserve.


Please check on your loved ones. Even those around you that you have little interactions with. Remember you can always make someones day a little better by just being kind which costs nothing. Thank you for taking the time to read.

I've been jaded and my heart hurts. I don't believe in love anymore because men continue to disappoint me and I disappoint myself. My heart is fragile around Christmas time and if a little bit of feelings leak out, I'm done for. And that's what happened this year. 

I was talking to this guy for a week but it was just me talking. Me asking questions, me starting the conversations, me trying to get to know this guy. We had a lot in common, but I guess he thought I was boring. Or maybe he was just using me for rebound because he ghosted me and shortly after talking with me his Facebook status says "in a relationship." 
What a dick.

For 26 years of my life, I've never dated before. Growing up as a closeted gay I didn't have any options to "date" either. So the idea of dating is just a fantasy to me. It's something I see in fairy tales. It's make-believe. It's not real. So I gave my body to random men looking for hook-ups and defiled my body.

I had to take a few shots of whisky and a few cans of alcohol to cleanse myself

My heart is fragile
So fragile 
I have to keep my heart in a cage 
and lock it up. 
My heart has all the love in the world to give
But no one to give to
My heart is fragile

En écoutant cela... je me rends compte dans quel état d'esprit je suis... Et ce dernier n'est pas beau à voir. En fait.. il n'y a pas que ça qui a changé... Mon moi a changé. La fille pleine d'ambition, de rêve, de bonheur est devenue cette fille qui ne croit plus à rien et surtout en elle, mais ça personne ne le sait... En 1 an, tout a basculé et me voilà à écrire ce tristre texte en essayant de me souvenir de chose positif que j'ai vécu cette année. Mais rien, rien ne vient, seulement du négatif. 2022 se résume, pour moi, en larmes, décès, cancer, déception, tristesse, vide, disputes et j'en passe. La chose qui m'a aidé; la musique.

J'aimerai remonter le temps et ne pas faire ce que j'ai fait.
J'aimerai remonter le temps et me préparer à ce désastre.
J'aimerais remonter le temps et me faire ouvrir les yeux.

Mais la vie n'est pas faite comme ça.

Bien au contraire.

Elle te met des épreuves plus dur les une que les autres. Et te teste au point de te détruire. Oui, elle est cruelle. Mais elle sait que tu es capable de surmonter ses épreuves. Et je le sais aussi.

But you use an umbrella to walk through it
You said you loved the sun 
Yet you seek shelter when it's shining 
You said you love wind
But when it comes to you
You close your doors
That's why I didn't believe when 
you said you loved me

But thats life and I will not give up on living but I wonder if I will ever truly be happy. I've been betrayed so many time by so many who I thought would never even in my dream do such thing. I am so pathetic right now can't even cry that the part that makes me sadder my tears won't even fall I want to cry but I am unable to man.i want to cry for hours so that I can wake up feeling a little less burdened

Well we don't need to care about those people who broke our heart, just focus on people who is still with us, if you think there is nobody, there is real you . There isn't just you who cry and feel bad about many things in world.

your worth it . eat . don’t h4rt urself . live a life that you like , society doesn’t matter . it matters what you think! u have one life , enjoy it <3 at times, u may feel hopeless and want to get out of this messed up world & messed up society , but remember that dream you had when u were little ? maybe it was a police, singer , make ur young self happy . whatever ur going threw is gonna be okay !! YOUR gonna be okay ! “don’t exist, live” < LOVE YOURSELF MAN , YOUR SO AMAZING OKAY ? don’t do it , you have a whole life ahead of you my guy ! yes , it might be terrible right now but it’s gonna get better . everything will . it’s hard but not impossible ?? still have stuffed animals? fuck it , i do too . don’t have real friends? i feel u. your not alone bae, ur not alone. sometimes u might feel like u don’t even know if ur sad, angry , mad, stressed but please don’t worry about that. don’t put pressure on urself for stupid reasons , ilysfm bro , i really do . and also for all the people with social anxiety ; if u ever feel like ur frozen and if u talk infront of someone it’ll be embarresing, but think bout it, when someome presents/talks a lot you won’t really care right? that’s how a lot of ppl feel like . they don’t care if u make mistakes , mistakes are normal . eventually everyone will die right? so there’s no point of hiding or acting like ur someone else. “life is like an exam , everyone tries to be like other people without knowing everyone has a different paper “ - me . TRIGGERING if u do !sh!  i’m truly sorry that u feel like that, but your beutiful and don’t deserve that shit. u really don’t. u deserve to be happy.

To everyone that happend to me. Long love between me and my friend, we felt something to each other, but never told eachother. I thought she likes someone else and she though same. Now we get in contact and I thought its the time we can get together. Everything was fine and nice between us but when I told her I am in love with her for a long long time she told me that she is meething with someone else for 8 months.  My heart in the moment I thought exploded from sadness. 

We have to stay strong, and put our heads up and smile for the good things that will happen in future. Everything is happening for reason. <3

My friend made a video of teasing my other friend, and I decided to get involved reading the face reveal of my other friend, baby and KingTails, KingTails made fun of baby's face reveal. And I decided to get involved rating the face reveal, just a six out of 10 but still offensive they all saw it. Once Max said to me you need respect to others because you're older than all of us. That got me emotional damage. But then 2 days later, I was just making a joke of calling my friend a chicken, and I decided to be a joker and just cry, and all of my friends were disappointed at me, instead I lost all my friends. The only one I did not lose, is Galaxy. Galaxy did not see the whole drama, and he's still a friend of mine. I did not consider Galaxy as my friend in the past, but now I just consider him as a friend. And I just feel full of depression. That's why I came here to listen to sad music. Dear god, hail Mary sweet Jesus, let me get my friends back, amen. I never pray to god, Jesus or hail Mary, but I finally did it. I just want everything back to normal, all because of my stupid idea.

Honestly at this point I listen to things like this while laying in bed and thinking about things like the fact that all the people who claim to be my friends are never there for me and how my own family doesn’t seem to care about me and how I can’t even find love no matter what I do and I can’t even cry when I listen to this it’s like if I’m just an empty shell with nothing left inside

Edit: About a month later, the feeling is going away sort of, it still hurts a lot, its kind of going away but it will never completely be gone. I've come back to this many times, reading through all of the comments. Thank you all for your support and everything.

Remember that even if you feel like everything is falling apart there is always someone that loves and cares about you.

Don't cry because it's over be happy that it happened


I've had a hard time myself and I can only say believe in yourself you can do everything you want to do 
Even if you think nobody believes in you i do 

Now go out there and show them how great you are

I thought I was alone... til I came to the comment section and realized that there are many like me. Silent, crying inside and afraid of the world. The world is a cold place and often times we're exploited as the weakest link for having a heart. I'm here, in your heart. Carry me around, talk to me, I feel your pain and you're never alone. I am you. Except in a different body. Different strifes. Different life. Same you. Can we show the world what we feel? The pain we hold inside and show the world that they neglected us but we forgive them because we don't want them to feel our pain..

Gente vou compartilhar algo q ando vendo bastante nos últimos meses,hj tava ouvindo musica no yt e dai cheguei nessa playlist aq e o me impressionou foi q a primeira musica é gospel,ando vendo bastante jovens ouvindo esse estilo de música sem serem cristãos e isso é maravilhoso,eu fiquei espantado em ver isso e ao msm tempo fiquei mt feliz,pq é uma forma de conhecerem e ver q o evangelho n é algo formado em cima de leis humanas e costumes antigos mas sim q é um evangelho legal e q tem um mundo que deve ser explorado mais e mais,mts jovens ficam espantados de saber q existe igreja com paredes pretas com luzes de led e q tocam rock pessado,ficam espantados de saber q existe trap gospel,rap,sertanejo,funk,então galera q ta lendo isso,seis tem q conhecer esse evangelho,o verdadeiro evangelho,gente é incrível é lokão kkkkk,eu era batera de um ministério q a gente tocava só rock e eletrônica e gente era mt bomm,era algo q eu me sentia bem sabe? Algo q me fazia bem e q eu sentia Deus através daquilo,tem cada coisa q a igreja pos como regra q n ta na biblia,n to generalizando mas tem igrejas q te julgam pelo jeito q vc se veste,q te julgam por ter tatuagem,genteeeee aonde issoooo??? Aaaaa 
To só desabafando um pouco e esperando q a galera q lê isso sinta interesse por esse evangelho verdadeiro
Jesus ama vcs d+????

to the person reading this,

It’s been hard for you, I know, and it makes me sad that you don’t see yourself in the way I see you. Sometimes they are things in life that cause us to lose ourselves, and the way you have is so unimaginable painful. I miss your smile, the way your eyes light up the whole room just by the sound of your laughter. I miss the way you accepted the way you look in the mirror without cursing yourself out about how ugly you look. I miss the way you didn’t think of yourself as a failure because everyone makes mistakes, we all have flaws and we all aren’t perfect. It’s painful to see that no one around you seems to see the pain through your eyes, but, stranger, I do, I see how heavy your heart is and how comforting the sadness for you might be, how afraid your heart is of happiness because it disappears in the end, right? You don’t know how much impact you have in this world and it’s sad to see that your demons fight against you and want to take over you. Because you do make a change, it’s something so simple and little that brightens up someone’s whole world, it can be a small smile from your lips, the way you look at things you’re passionate about, the way you make yourself eat even though it’s been hard for you lately, the way you zoom out and go in your own world, you brighten up my world by reading this, it means a lot to me that you’re here, existing, but I don’t want you to just exist, you deserve to feel alive. You deserve to get up in the morning and feel good about yourself. You deserve to feel something- to feel every damn second alive in this lifetime. It’s heartbreaking that you think you’re not capable of being loved because you are, I love you through all my words and I hope you let it happen in your heart. Love is scary, I know, maybe your heart had been broken once and since then you wanted to be rather numb than feel ever again, it hurts me how you punish yourself, does it not deserve love? Because YOU DO deserve love, please forgive yourself, it’s not your fault that the demons want to take over your beautiful heart. You’re not a bad person for distancing yourself from others, but you deserve someone to talk to, you deserve someone to listen. I am listening, you can tell me what’s wrong. It’s everything, isn’t it? There’s something pulling your heartstrings on the ground and no one seems to understand how misunderstood you feel, it’s heartbreaking to know that I am behind the screen and can’t give you a hug, that’s why I will give you a big warm virtual hug and send you lots of love :). You matter. You are worthy. You are loved. You deserve good things. You deserve someone to listen. You deserve to eat and drink. You deserve to feel good and alive. You deserve to smile. You deserve a hug. You deserve to be all the things you want to be because you deserve to have and feel good things happening to you and have a fulfilled life. I know I might not know you personally but I care about you so much, I write this because I want you to stay here with me, I want you to hold on a little longer because you matter so much to me, because I will not let you give up on yourself. I want you to see that you should not give up on yourself because you DESERVE GOOD THINGS. I want you to look back on the time when you were a kid, you didn’t give up when you tried to swim for the first time, you didn’t give up when you tried to walk for the first time and fell, you never gave up on yourself, you always kept on pushing forwards, so why can’t you now? I know it’s tiring, your mentally tired, but don't your younger self deserve good things? look back at your eyes that used to be full of hope, look back on those dreams. Don’t let yourself fall, you deserve better. We will both fight, I will fight for you. I won’t let those demons get to you. You can hold on to me, I won’t let you down :). Whenever you feel lonely, then look at the sky, I always look at it and think about you. Yes, you, because it makes me happy that there’s someone looking right back, maybe we can’t see each other but I can feel your presence here with me and that’s enough for me because I am glad your heart is beating and you’re still fighting. You’re so much stronger thank you think, you didn’t leave your spot on this earth even if you wanted to, you belong here, even though it doesn’t feel like it when you don’t feel like belonging then build your own home here, put all your love in it and dreams. Think of you as a star when you feel alone, you shine because your heart is good, no matter what mistake you made, no matter about the past you had, you’re one of the stars that shine bright in the universe because you’re heart is beautiful, that’s why the demons in your mind want to have it. As one of the stars you see other stars, maybe they have felt the same way as you do at some point in their life, but they lighten up the universe with each other’s presence. You’re a star for me, maybe you don’t see it yourself but I can see it, you’re beautiful from inside and out, your body is beautiful the way it is. You make me happy by reading this, you make me feel something by your presence, and when you can make me feel that way then you also make other people feel that way about you too. I hope you stay for yourself and don’t let your story get written by others but by yourself, it’s your story, not theirs. As you can see, I say a lot of “I hope” because I have hope for you even if you don’t have it for yourself, I see hope in you even though you might want to give up. That’s why I hope you won’t see the world in darkness and will see it colorful again, I hope I will give you a glimpse of hope and make the world you see a bit colorful for today. My favorite color is yellow, and I hope the next time you see the color yellow you will think about my words. If someone left you then don’t blame yourself, don’t think you weren’t enough, don’t lower yourself for someone who couldn’t see the awesomeness in you. If you lost someone I am so sorry for your loss, they want you happy, I hope you don’t feel guilty or regret because you were there, you spend enough time with them, they want you to be happy. They are in a good and safe place now. If someone broke your heart then I am so sorry that they couldn’t see the way you look so beautiful because of the heart you have. Anyone who gets to be with you doesn’t know how fucking lucky he/ she/ they are :). If you aren’t accepted at home or in general then I am so sorry that you have to deal with someone/ something you shouldn’t be ashamed of, I accept you and support you, I accept you as a human being no matter what race, religion, nationality, skin color, or sexuality you have. You’re safe here with me :). You’re not useless, you’re not a burden to anyone. You’re not a problem, you’re human and your feelings are valid. You’re not being dramatic. Please don’t starve yourself, you deserve food and to drink, I know it’s hard. It hurts to see that you’re in so much pain :( you deserve so much man, don’t let your emotions control you. Don’t let them get the best of you.  I am sorry no one is noticing, I wish /hope I could take your pain away for today or even for a moment while you’re reading this. If no one told you, I am so proud of you, you’re reading this and it’s enough for me to be proud of you because you’re here and that’s all that matters to me. If it’s the night for you, go to sleep, I know it’s hard to fall asleep right now but you deserve a good sleep. If you have nightmares, please, don’t let them fight you. If it’s the day for you, don’t start it with such sad music, I know it’s impossible to have a good day with such a mindset but take baby steps, start by drinking two cups of water every day in the morning, and so on. You will start building little healthy habits. If it’s the evening for you, you’re probably overwhelmed and stressed, I want you to know it’s okay to feel the way you feel. You don’t need to be scared, of course, you’re overwhelmed or stressed, I mean who wouldn’t? But it’s important to know that when you feel that way you should do a little self-care, such as taking a bath for example? You deserve to feel at ease and relaxed. 
And if you are somewhere in between I hope you know that you’re so strong for breathing despite the pain, I know you will make it :) I believe in you. All I want for you is to stay here, I really mean all my words, even if there is a lot of unsaid things I want to tell u and my text is getting longer and longer, I want you here. 

I hope one day your smile will become a genuine one where you don’t need to fake it anymore because I can’t say this enough, you deserve a good smile and to feel alive. You’re worth more than every fucking cent in this world.

You can let go for today, I got you, you can cry your heart out as much as you want, but don’t let it tear you down and let your emotions control you by giving up. Crying is not a weakness. If you still feel alone I dedicate you to a song as your friend.
“Dusk till Dawn- Zayn feat. Sia (I prefer the slow version)” I hope you can think of me and will remind yourself of my words, I will for sure think of you. 

In case no one told you and you’re unsure yourself, you’re a good person and I am so happy you’re here. 

I hope this is enough to stay today, tomorrow will be a new day, a new start, let go now. Enough with beating yourself up for today, okay? 

Life for those who couldn’t smile for those who forgot what a genuine smile is, love like there’s no other, hug-like it's your last one. 

If you read all of it, until tomorrow my friend :) 
have a good day and a great year.
Not mine but u can spread it :)

Fighting is hard, especially when no one is ready to help you. 
Losing someone hurts, especially when you couldn't even hug them goodbye.
Dying is scary, but that's the time when we can finally rest.
But still, don't be swayed by this. Instead, make it reason to become stronger. More amazing stuffs ahead. Enjoy every second of your life, because many peoples still wants to live.

Don't give up. Fighting!

To the people who are crying inside or outside their heart " I'm not gonna say it's gonna get better because life shows you happiness for one brief glimpse to let you know what you're missing out on. And then something bigger emotionally draining will come by whether it's your parents or siblings or friends or others who are the cause or you yourself. All you gotta say to yourself is "I'm gonna start loving you the way you are one day and no one's hate is gonna change that."

Umm....what can I say? Depression is real. I'm not the type that if you looked at me you would think I got it all figured out, but no. I've spent nights crying in my bed, in someone's else's car, at another person's house just because I hide my pain to make everyone else happy. This soundtrack helped me with my feelings. I needed a way to cope. Not with therapists, doctors, or a "facility". Just crying in my room with my own space and alone. You never know how much you can cry until you do it all night long.

I listen to music like this so I can feel some thing on the inside.  I can shut of my pain and hurt with music like this. I can let it out without being judged. It always seems that people across the world cares more about you then the people you actually know

"Depression is being colorblind and constantly told how colorful the world is."
- Atticus

P.S. To anyone reading this, only if its alright and if it isnt that selfish of me, please whisper a prayer for me and my family? Truly needed it at this point. ?? Been a long and repetitive battle. ??
Please pray for our total healing, stable source of income and may we finally afford to move out and have a place of our own, for our peace of mind, its so painful to keep on walking on eggshells in someone else's place, and not knowing when we'll get kicked  again. ??
May help finally arrive. ?? 
Thank you and GOD bless. ????

I’ve started swimming in this ocean only 3 years ago,
I can’t escape it,
The current gets stronger and pulls my back from land,
I try and try,
I drown, I get back up, I drown, I drown,
Save me from these emotions,
They washed me here and I can’t find my way.

Tbh I was here to say this: I had depression,I learned to not fight it. I learned to be with it. If you have depression, take a moment. Hug yourself. I wanted to be out of the hole so bad. Really hug yourself, communicate with your body. Your hope will leave, but hope will not leave you. But there’s one thing that really helped me. Mindfulness. Whatever your going through, I know you don’t know me, but I will stat hopeful for u. :)

A few years ago, I met a girl in a school. Before I fell in love with her, she was just a classmate. Our class went on an excursion and it was normal until the way back home. I was just looking outside the window feeling bored and sad when someone randomly snatched my cap from my head. I was really pissed because I thought it was a stupid prank from one of my friends but when I looked back, it was her, with a playful face and a beautiful smile. Her smile drove away all the pain and sadness that was in me for a long time. It was on that day that I fell in love with her, that she was the love of my life. We talked everyday for months but one day, she said she didn't feel interested in me anymore because it seemed she didn't want to settle for any long-term relationship. I was devastated, I couldn't sleep for days just sitting down and crying in my room. Up till now I've been carrying the pain I felt and I'm trying to be a better person, so that one day if we ever cross paths, I'd have my chance to confess and hope that she feels the same. Until then, I'll be harboring my hopes and keep working on myself to be better for me, and mainly for her.

dear you or whoever is struggling right now, if you're reading this remember that you are loved by someone, even if this person may not be here now. I am sure that someone cherishes you and loves you, and eventually, you will find that person. So don’t give up, it may be hard now, but things will be better I promise. Have faith, hope, and know that you are working hard, and trying your best, you are amazing, and beautiful inside and outside, and deserve to be loved, and find happiness. It’s okay to feel sad, angry, jealous, mad, happy because that’s what makes you human. Don’t let yourself down, there is always light at the end of the tunnel, you’ve been alive till now. You survived through all of this, you deserve to be proud of yourself! Don’t underestimate yourself, don’t let words bring you down, you are better and worth more than that. There is something to live for. Your kindness is like a candle, when it lights up, it brings a happy smile to others! :) Take care of your health, drink water, eat healthy food, and play sports! Wear warm outfits, your mental well-being is a priority. Beautiful soul, remember to smile because a smile is what suits your pretty face the best! :) In life, you might face decisions that others may laugh at, or make fun of, it gets really hard. But think about it like this, do their opinions really matter? is it my happiness or theirs? is it my life or theirs? do I not take control of my own happiness and decisions? Have the courage to stand up for what you believe in, and write your own destiny, because you will find out that you lived a life filled with regrets, not full of choices. That's it, you have the gift and talent, so grab the chance, make the most of it, it's only one life we live in. Others are flying, why don't you take the risk too? You might succeed and fly, or fall back, but either way, you can stand up and give it another try. Because if you don't fail then you are not trying. Look at all those masterminds and successful people, from where did they get all the success? They failed, Thomas Edison failed 100 times, and in try 101, he made the light bulb. Behind every success, there is a backstory of sleepless nights, blood, sweat, tears, stress and you name it. It's okay to fail, it's ok to not feel alright, and it’s okay not to feel like giving up. Make mistakes, learn, grow and flourish! Go to the mirror, and praise yourself, say that you are proud of yourself, that you are beautiful, and are doing amazing, be compassionate with yourself, don't push yourself to the limit :)!! I thank you for your existence on earth, you are important, and make this universe brighter, it will never be the same without you <3 and lastly, I love you, and I'm here for you :D take care, fighter! it will pass, and you're worthy, you're valid, you're appreciated, you're important and amazing. I will fight you to remind you of how precious your existence is >:( and I'm here to support you all the way because you will make it, I know you will. you are enough, and will always be. I'm sending you the biggest warm hug and telling you that's going to be okay. everything has a solution, don’t give up yet, I know that you will be alright and I strongly believe so, you may not believe me now and that’s okay because being alright takes time in these rough times you’re going through right now are not the end and they do not determine your worth in any way, they’re just a chapter that you’ll always remember as the most painful moments you had to live through and that’s it, they are not a measure of self-worth and you deserve to live, you deserve that I know that you will ace everything you just need to give it time maybe not today, not tomorrow, or a month later, but it will be soon. you don’t know who I am, however I know that you’re a person who deserved kindness. Nobody is born bad, no one can choose whether you’re a good or bad person. You misbehave? Happens. No one is holy, no one is a saint. You’re just right even with the shit you may have done, everyone does shit, everyone falls, everyone fails. The important thing is that you learn how to get up and look toward the future. What’s in the past stays there, your pain, your tears, your mistakes. You can’t change the past but you can change the future. The future isn’t written, isn’t it? See yourself as a poem, poems are beautiful but take time, but it takes time to make them beautiful, and it takes time to write them and do them just right. You’re the poem and the poet, it takes time to heal and get better, but every day you’re closer to it. And I’m proud of you, so should you, for writing such a nice poem. And if you aren’t ready to show this poem to others don’t, nevertheless personally I love the poem, even if I don’t know it yet, I just love it because I know the poet is taking time to finish it. So take your time and write a beautiful poem about yourself, okay? keep shining, you're a bright star <3

These are not my words, they are from a kind angel below

These songs reminds me of my grandma ?? 
Sorry for what makes you feel this way, but you are, and always will be the best version of you ,when you are genuinely happy about yourself. It might sound harsh but you will always remain the biggest fan of yourself...yea you might have that one person or person(s) who really cares...and in your mind if you are saying "but I have no one" then,you get it...you are beautiful,charismatic purposeful and all good qualities that the little you envisioned for him/her self then...just take a look at any little kid in his\her zone...the kid literally does'nt give a f*ck about the external environment...by just losing themselves in whatever they do,they  bring the sparkle that everyone loves about babies and kids...they just do it, and oftenly, you'll see this is followed up by the crack of a genuine laugh...this is true happiness, Ik I don't know you beyond your yt username but believe me when I say I care and want to see you happy and smile genuinely like the little kid...you deserve to be happy and the best part is once you get how valuable you are in this world we live in, you will get it done!!!That dream you are passionate about, when you get lost in it you can heal(self) and be the champion you are born to be.....I can go on and on and scream to the top of my lungs to cheer you on and help you get to see how great you are but I can never match the cheerleader in you...so fuck what people are going to say at the end of the day;JUST DO IT FOR YOU and never let yourself go when it get's be tougher instead. You are a star;get this in your mindset and let others tell you how shiny you are....I have a great feeling that I'll meet you there at the top.Have a good lifetime of bringing your masterpiece to the world.WE NEED IT

"true pain isnt tears its the heart that feels and your mind that hurts" all im saying is that when you feel true pain is when your chest starts hurting you start crying till the point you cant cry anymore but taste salt so keep going there is always something good at the end of your pain and suffering

When I was younger I'd wish for everyone else's happiness not realizing how much I needed to be happy but now I have to help people because if I don't im  a terrible person and then if I wanted  to help myself I couldn't I don't have time for me and I am just used and replace. Kinda like a screw you think that you'll keep me forever and that I'll be a good choice but you'll change your mind you'll use me for a month or two and then you won't even care.

I had my gf but she just die ???? i miss here this song makes me cry
lone 
Sadness 
Tears in eyes
Nobody to understand
No one to hug
No one to explain what's going on
Thinking all are selfish
No one to share feeling
No one to help 
Family problems
Study problem
Problem problem problem......

But still there is a hope that this all will end one day there will be someone who is actually made for us there will be someone who will really understand us there will be someone who will end this all and make us all happy.I don't know from where this all is coming in my mind I am just like you come to listen the sad songs but I think there is someone some energy who is letting me to get out of this and as well as to motivate you all. Now I am really feeling great and free I wish you will also write whatever is in our hearts I will be happy because of me there is someone who actually will able to share his/her problem with me and who ever will be reading this comment.
Love you all??

You are AMAZING
You are BEAUTIFUL
You are TALENTED
You are STRONG

And remember, there is or there will be ALWAYS someone who LOVES you ??

Don't listen to any of those negative words about you no matter what it is. Take care of yourself and try to seek help from others! I know it might be hard but it will help you.

100 reasons why you shouldn't commit suicide:
1. We would miss you.
2. It’s not worth the regret. Either by yourself, if you failed or just simply left scars or the regret everyone else feels by not doing enough to help you.
3. It does get better. Believe it or not, it will eventually get better. Sometimes you have to go through the storm to get to the rainbow.
4. There’s so much you would miss out on doing.
5. There is always a reason to live. It might not be clear right now, but it is always there.
6. So many people care, and it would hurt them if you hurt yourself.
7. You ARE worth it. Don’t let anyone, especially yourself, tell you otherwise.
8. You are amazing.
9. A time will come, once you’ve battled the toughest times of your life and are at ease once again, where you will be so glad that you decided to keep on living. You will emerge stronger from this all, and won’t regret your choice to carry on with life. Because things always get better.
10. What about all the things you’ve always wanted to do? What about the things you’ve planned, but never got around to doing? You can’t do them when you’re dead.
11. I love you. Even if only one person loves you, that’s still a reason to stay alive.
12. You won’t be able to listen to music if you die.
13. Killing yourself is never worth it. You’ll hurt both yourself and all the people you care about.
14. There are so many people that would miss you, including me.
15. You’re preventing a future generation, YOUR KIDS, from even being born.
16. How do you think your family would feel? Would it improve their lives if you died?
17. You’re gorgeous, amazing, and to someone you are perfect.
18. Think about your favorite music artist, you’ll never hear their voice again…
19. You’ll never have the feeling of walking into a warm building on a cold day
20. Listening to incredibly loud music
21. Being alive is just really good.
22. Not being alive is really bad.

45. Traveling to another planet someday.
46. Having an underwater house.
47. Randomly running into your hero on the street.
48. Having your own room at a fancy hotel.
49. Trampolines.
50. Think about your favorite movie, you’ll never watch it again.
51. Think about the feeling of laughing out loud in a public place because your best friend has just sent you an inside joke,
52. Your survival will make the world better, even if it’s for just one person or 20 or 100 or more.
53. People do care.
54. Treehouses
55. Hanging out with your soulmate in a treehouse
56. Snorting when you laugh and not caring who sees
57. I don’t even know you and I love you.
58. I don’t even know you and I care about you.

80. Be yourself, don’t take anyone’s shit, and never let them take you alive.

83. One day your smile will be real.
84. Having a really hot, relaxing bath after a stressful day.
85. Lying on the grass and laughing at the clouds.
86. Getting completely smashed with your best friends.
87. Eating crazy food.
88. Staying up all night watching your favorite films with a loved one.
89. Sleeping all day.
90. Creating something you’re proud of.
91. You can look back on yourself 70 years later and be proud you didn’t commit suicide.
92. Being able to meet your Internet friends.
93. Tea / Coffee / Hot Chocolate
94. The new season of Sherlock
95. Cuddling under the stars.
96. Being stupid in public because you just can.
97. If you are reading this then you are alive! Is there any more reason to smile?
98. Being able to hug that one person you haven’t seen in years
99. People care enough about you and your future to come up with 100 reasons for you not to do this.
100. But, the final and most important one is, just, being able to experience life. Because even if your life doesn’t seem so great right now, anything could happen.


Please remember that your important and to contact somone or talk to someone if your feeling suicidal. Please take care of yourself, eat,drink,brush,wash anything and everything to take care of yourself.

If it's night time, remember to put your phone on the charger,make sure you have everything set and try and get some sleep okay? Hopefully the next day will be better and the days after that.

If it's the evening it might seem rough right now but I promise they'll get better. Take care of yourself and remember to make time for your hobbies and interests.

If it's the morning don't start off with such a bad mood! I know it sucks to have to get up and go to school or work but I promise the day will be good! Don't overwork yourself okay?


I love you and you're important! Please take care of yourself and seek help if your feeling suicidal or depression. Remember you're important and there's no one like you! If you ever need to talk to someone you can always talk to me! And please take care of yourself for me  And remember it's okay to cry, it's a way of the body letting out it's emotions!

Go get some rest dear! And remember your valid <3

listening to this and not crying is a miracle for me, can't believe am even praying for God to forgive me for those that I hurt and to help me forgive those that hurt me , a big miracle for someone who used to cry every night because of loneliness and relationships , am still the same person but I pray to be okay and enjoy my season


almost 7 months without listening to this and am back to it , this time  am pregnant and I have nothing figured out for this child , always asking myself am I going to be a good mother to the child , accepting the pregnancy was also a hard thing but here I am 17 weeks and still crying coz I am pregnant , i didn't grow up with my mother so i always feel the need to protect my bby I just don't know how to do it and how to provide for it

Oh, my heart

Why did you let fall in love

For one who never loved you

One who never will;





I'll make a promise

Never to love again

One who only make me suffer

One who only make me cry;





I need to stop

Stop falling in love

For one who only make me suffer

One who only make me cry;





It is so bad

Getting hurt by someone

The heart goes ill

Embarassed and shy;





It hurts too much

Who loves knows the feel

What goes through our mind

When it's time to let it go;





Never again

I'll taste your kisses

Never again

I'll have you in my arms;





I wonder

If I'm better alone

If so

It's easier to forgive myself;





But the love

Sometimes only misleads us

I don't know

With you it might be different





Oh, my heart...

I still remember when I was labeled as the class clown the guy that makes peoples days better. I miss those times because that’s when I felt like I had a purpose in life. And now all I can do is cry myself to sleep every night knowing that I’m just a disappointment, waste of time and better off dead.

sorry for venting.

People will say their biggest fears are things like animals, insects, heights etc. I used to think my biggest fear was not being able to see the world anymore. But I’m not sure anymore. Why would I want to see the world as I see it now. I realized something laying here. My biggest fear is losing them all me, being the youngest in my family. My dog, my parents, grand parents, siblings, friends. I’m genuinely scared.

I  just want to go home.
I just want to feel loved
I just want to be hold even if it's for a millisecond.
But the real question is where is my home !
When will I be able to call a place my home , my safe place!
Cz I've Never felt safe with my parents , never felt worthy enough of anything.
Never have I ever been able to ask my mom for a gentle hug...

Then , where'll I go !
My friend don't even think I consider them as friend.
They think I don't love them , Even if I do everything for them, make sacrifices after sacrifices ; at last they will still say - " you don't care about me.
You don't love me ."


Then tell me how to make you understand that I love you ! 
Tell me , fucking tell me !!

My only problem is that I love too much.
I'm attached too easily and I hate that I'm like that .

But what can you expect from a girl who has never been able to have someone by her side !
Obviously she will try her best to keep that person to her.


Huh , haha look mom look , I'm so pathetic.
I'm writing down my emotions in a comment box .
That's how lonely I'm.
That's how hurt I'm 
That's how your words , their words are breaking my heart..

Do the conference of life people say that you grow up as a child being happy and mean so happy but things are more crazy and you could just can't take it you want to die you want to do things that are impossible but your mind and your feelings are just so jacked up to the point where you just can't take it but living a life that's inducive to you and your mind set you just can't take it and through life it does get better but it will go drastically down the drain if you don't take care of you I'm a person that's never been taken care of I always took care of myself and always seek relationship or seek someone to help me and never helps and I always thinking about dying and doing everything possible in my life to get better and back on track to be having a better mindset and it's just hard you can never put yourself in a liability where you just want to die and it's kind of hard just living on this earth with no meaning no purpose no comfort it's just hard and you want to go and be free from your mind free from your mind and the gods will never help you until you help yourself and be you and don't let people be in your life messing up and just try to be a person that is willing to seek help or live with your depression and your anxiety like I try to do that and it's so hard you try and try you try to cry you try to do everything but it's just hard I want to see good but I want to do things that put me in a good spot in life but it's just hard to think and feel emotions that are not even there

Hey!:maybe you try to cry but you can't ! 
  I know how its feels ! When you go to bed ! But everything you did ,you shoundt,you could do,things happened before ! And things you expect everthing goes wrong ! They all playing in you're mind llike a movie ! You want to be found ! You want attention! You want to be comfort ! The words you telling others ! There will be someone ! For you ! Maybe not tommorow but someday you will find someone that chnage you're life ! And you will find out meaning of you're existing.
   Sometimes ! You feel so much relax when you say all you're pain to someone ! Not because they can help ! A good listener all you need soemtime ! If someone wants to talk ! I'm here

Reasons why you should stay alive.



1. We would miss you. 



2. It's not worth the regret. Either by yourself if you failed or just simply left scars, or the regret everyone else feels by not doing enough to help you. 



3. It does get better. Believe it or not it will eventually get better. Sometimes you have to go through the storm to get to the rainbow. 



4. There's so much you would miss out on doing. 



5. There is always a reason to live. It might not be clear right now, but it is always there. 



6. So many people care, and it would hurt them if you hurt yourself. 



7. You ARE worth it. Don't let anyone, especially yourself, tell you otherwise. 



8. You are amazing. 



9. A time will come, once you've battled the toughest times of your life and are in ease once again, where you will be so glad that you decided to keep on living. You will emerge stronger from this all, and won't regret your choice to carry on with life. Because things always get better. 



10. What about all the things you've always wanted to do? What about the things you've planned, but never got around to doing? You can't do them when you're dead. 



11. I love you. Even if only one person loves you, that's still a reason to stay alive. 



12. You won't be able to listen to music if you die. 



13. Killing yourself is never worth it. You'll hurt both yourself and all the people you care about.

I’ve had social anxiety for basically as long as I can remember. I overthink everything, I only have 1 friend but I moved and now we don’t see each other much. We used to fix that by playing video games, but he doesn’t like the same games as me and he found a new group to play those with. I had to go to a new school and I was so anxious that when I had to go in and meet my teachers a week before school started I cried and tried to hide it but I couldn’t when I met my math teacher. I could barely make eye contact with him that semester. I would overthink about every mistake I made that day and it would keep me up, I wouldn’t get much sleep, sometimes I would stress myself out so much that I had migraines lasting 12-15 hours. I missed a lot of school, and I didn’t talk to many people. I sat alone in the back of the classroom since day one. A nice girl sat next to me once and was wondering if I wanted to be her friend. I kind of agreed, but we didn’t actually hang out or talk most of the time she just sat next to me in that one class. She didn’t even know what I looked like, I was good at hiding. I had a hoodie on every day and never took my mask off even they weren’t required and I had gym class. Let’s just say I didn’t stay at that school long. I switched to online after the semester and I get so worked up about simple things like typing an answer in the chat, or submitting assignments, or sending emails. I definitely can’t turn on my camera or mic in zoom meets. I’m in a group on discord with my 1 friend and his new group of friends and I can kind of call my “friends” but not really. I like one of them, but we aren’t close and I basically only know him through my friend. I used to play Minecraft with my friend and his new friend that I like. I guess it’s wrong to call him his new friend since they’re played for like a year now but he lives across the country so we only know him online. Earlier there were like 6 people in an open discord call in the group. I waited 5 minutes after I saw it before I joined because I was overthinking what game they would be on or if they would care if I was even there, or if I could hold a convo with one of them. I joined and nobody really mentioned that I joined I just kind of blended in with them like I didn’t just join out of nowhere. They were playing games I didn’t have and I didn’t want to get so I asked for the new Minecraft server ip from my friend’s “new” friend and he said he would give it to me but he forgot for like 10 minutes and I hadn’t said almost anything in that time it was like I wasn’t there, and I was too nervous to ask for the ip again, so I just left. I almost hoped that my friend would dm me and ask why I left or sat goodnight or something, but nothing. Didn’t care if I joined, or left. He doesn’t even text me anymore. Our last 30 Convos are me asking if he is on and wants to play a game with me and him not responding for a long time and then just saying sorry and not wanting to or just saying that he’s going to bed. We say we’re best friends but what does that really mean? That title must not mean much since I don’t know where we stand as friends. He comes over once every couple weeks and we’re always bored. Nothing to talk about, and we don’t play the same games, so no games. Mostly just walks, sitting, or cooking our dinner or something. But none of that is very time consuming. Of course I can’t talk to him about any of that because I’m too anxious. I mean I’ll go to the living room to ask my mom what’s for dinner or if we can go to the grocery store for something and sometimes I overthink about it and then try to distract myself and then realize that I still have to ask and then I over think again. Sometimes it takes like 1-3 hours before I get the courage to ask. That crushing since my mom has so much more to her life that my one question was such a small thing that she just says “sure” and puts her shoes on or just answers “I don’t know what’s for dinner” and my 1-3 hours was just for that second long response that she didn’t even have to think about. I have no motivation and I’m always tired and my grades aren’t doing the greatest. Don’t really even know what my personality is anymore. I overthink so much and am so nervous about everything that I don’t recognize my self the only personality traits I know at this point are emotional, overthinking, and being anxious.

I guess this was just a giant rant since I don’t have anyone else to go to right now. Just had to get those things off my chest, and truthfully, I feel way better now than 20 minutes ago.

The sudden self-realization that one was left behind by the rest of the world... A long long time ago... Nothing enjoyed is good enough anymore... or even at all...  Nothing seems good enough anymore and one took too long-t's over.  
Why? Because one knows they failed. Now one sits here listening and wondering why one bothered and wasted their time... No one cares really, its all just one. But for those that do care? They aren't exactly proud. To the point that one just presses stop in this video and just stares at the paused screen in a blank stare... No game good enough to erase this... No movie seen, no book read no tic-tock reviewed, no song listened to, nothing... And I mean NOTHING is good enough to make one feel better... 
Especially on Dec 23... 

Whos here with me..?

Tanong ko lang, in you own perspective kung nakakasakal naba yung ginagawa ng mama ko o hindi.

Ganito iyun, ako hindi ako nagagala gala araw araw 'di tulad ng dalawa kong mga kapatid na lalaki (kuya at bunso), kapag may research ako, assignments reports na gagawin sa powerpoint which is hindi madali lalong lalo na ang reporting kasi nga diba mag reresearch ka tas madami kang sources na titingnan kung tama ba yung information na nakuha mo, hindi yan natatapos isang araw lang yung ginugugul ko sa isang araw ay nasa 7 hours lang tas sa crossing ako gumagawa non, minsan gagabihin ako, pero kung makapag salita mama ko parang wala akong kwenta hindi ko raw gingawa ang mga gawaing bahay like hugas ng linggan HELLO! BUSY AKO MA SA ACADEMICS MARAMI AKONG GINAGAWA! , Minsan lang nga ako gumagala at kung gumagala namn ako ay kapag may practice sa school, gumawa ng reports tas sasabihan niya ako na wala akong kwenta,(hindi niya literal na sinabi pero parang yun yung meaning na sinasabi niya), ako ang parating sinisisi bat hindi niya sinisisi mga kapatid ko na puro lakwatsa at online games ang inaatupag habang ako nasa bahay lang? Parang feeling ko wala akong opinyon sa bahay, nakakainis lang ilang beses ko nang tinangkang magpakamatY kasi feeling ko ang toxic niya
