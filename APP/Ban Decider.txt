As for the policies, it is important to have clear and fair rules in place to ensure a positive and safe environment for all users. Some possible considerations for these policies could include:

    Defining acceptable and unacceptable behavior, such as harassment, trolling, and spamming
    Outlining the consequences for violating these rules, including warnings, temporary bans, and permanent bans
    Providing a way for users to report inappropriate behavior, such as through a dedicated "report" button or by contacting a moderator
    Ensuring that all reports are investigated promptly and fairly, with appropriate action taken based on the findings
    Providing resources and support for users who have experienced harassment or other negative behavior, including access to mental health professionals or other support services
