sample code for implementing a machine learning model that takes in a dataset as input and trains on it

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('dataset.csv')

# Split the dataset into features (X) and labels (y)
X = data.iloc[:, :-1]
y = data.iloc[:, -1]

# Split the data into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

# Scale the data using Standard Scaler
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Fit the linear regression model to the training data
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model on the test data
score = model.score(X_test, y_test)
print(f'Test score: {score:.2f}')


This code first loads a dataset from a CSV file, then splits it into features and labels. It then splits the data into training and test sets, scales the data using Standard Scaler, and fits a linear regression model to the training data. Finally, it evaluates the model on the test data and prints the score.

You can modify this code to suit your specific needs, such as using a different machine learning model or preprocessing the data in a different way.
